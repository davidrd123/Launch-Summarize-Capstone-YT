# Capstone Project: Tackle Box

## Introduction

The Tackle Box project is an open-source serverless framework designed to simplify the deployment and management of webhooks. In this coding Capstone project, the team presents Tackle Box as a comprehensive solution for managing webhooks, providing an overview of its features, architecture, and benefits. They also discuss the challenges they faced during development and outline potential future improvements.

The video presentation begins with an introduction to webhooks and their importance in enabling real-time notifications and automated actions based on specific events. The team highlights the challenges of building and scaling webhooks, including handling failed messages, ensuring security and authentication, and monitoring endpoints. They then explain the trade-offs between using commercial webhook solutions and building an in-house solution.

## ELI5 Summary

Webhooks are like secret messengers that deliver important messages to specific people whenever something special happens. But sending these messages can be tricky and time-consuming. Sometimes companies build their own messengers, or they use commercial messengers that handle everything for them. But the problem is, if they use a commercial messenger, they don't have much control over their messages, and they can't customize them as much as they want.

That's where Tackle Box comes in. Tackle Box is like a special toolbox that helps companies easily send messages to the right people at the right time. It's open-source, which means anyone can use it and customize it however they want. With Tackle Box, companies can quickly set up their own messengers, send messages to multiple applications, and have full control over their data. It makes everything easier and more efficient.

## Tools Used

The Tackle Box project utilizes a variety of tools to achieve its goals. Here is a list of the specific tools used:

### Cloud Services

- AWS (Amazon Web Services)
  - API Gateway
  - Lambda Functions
  - Simple Notification Service (SNS)
  - Simple Queue Service (SQS)
  - CloudWatch Logs
  - Cloud Development Kit (CDK)
- PostgreSQL (Relational Database)

### Languages

- JavaScript
- Ruby
- Python
- Go

### Other Technologies

- CLI Tool
- Management UI
- Client Libraries
- Chart.js (Data Visualization Library)
- React (JavaScript Library for UI)

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Building and managing webhooks can be challenging and time-consuming, especially when dealing with multiple applications. Commercial webhook solutions offer convenience but limit control and customization options. The goal of the Tackle Box project is to provide an open-source framework that simplifies webhook deployment and management for small to medium-sized applications while offering control over data and customization options.

### Solution

Tackle Box is an open-source serverless framework designed to provide a centralized solution for managing webhooks. It aims to simplify the integration process, ensure data consistency, and give developers control over their data. The project consists of various components, including a CLI tool, a management UI, client libraries in multiple languages (JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Go), and a webhook service with a RESTful API and AWS infrastructure.

### Features

1. Centrally Manage Webhooks: Tackle Box allows for the central management of webhooks, enabling granular control over which events trigger notifications.

2. Simplify Integration Process: The project provides client libraries in multiple languages to standardize and simplify the integration of webhooks into applications.

3. Ensure Data Consistency: Tackle Box maintains data consistency across applications by persisting every message sent and offering a user-friendly interface to view message history.

4. Easy Deployment and Management: The framework offers a straightforward deployment process through the CLI tool or management UI. It provisions the necessary AWS resources for the webhook service and allows for easy teardown to avoid unnecessary costs.

### Architecture

Tackle Box's architecture revolves around the event message life cycle and is designed to efficiently handle the trigger-notification-message delivery process. The key components of the architecture include:

1. API Gateway: Acts as the entry point for Tackle Box and passes incoming notifications to an intake lambda function.

2. Lambda Functions: AWS Lambda functions handle various processes such as handling notifications, creating and sending messages, persisting messages to the database, and coordinating interactions between the database and SNS.

3. Simple Notification Service (SNS): Used for message sending, SNS employs a publish-subscribe model to deliver messages to subscribing endpoints.

4. Simple Queue Service (SQS) (Optional): SQS can be used as a reliable storage system to handle message retries and avoid unnecessary polling.

5. CloudWatch Logs: Logs specific events, which can be utilized to transfer message data from logs to the main message history.

### Demo

The video presentation includes a brief demo of Tackle Box's management UI, showing how to configure webhooks, specify event types, manage subscriptions, and monitor webhook requests. The UI provides detailed information about headers, payloads, and the performance of webhooks.

### Future Ideas

The team intends to enhance Tackle Box by adding new features such as webhook throttling, message deduplication, and payload transformations. They also aim to expand the list of supported client libraries to accommodate more programming languages.
