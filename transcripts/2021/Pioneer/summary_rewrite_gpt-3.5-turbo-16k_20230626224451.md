# Capstone Project: Pioneer - Feature Flag Management Tool

## Introduction

Welcome and thank you for joining us today. In this YouTube video, we will discuss the Pioneer project, a self-hosted feature flag management tool developed by a team of creators. The team consists of Kyle, Jimmy Zheng, Elizabeth Tackett, and the presenter. The video covers various aspects of the project, including the problems Pioneer solves, the concept of feature flags, an overview of the application, technical decisions and challenges faced during development, and potential future work.

## ELI5 Summary

Imagine you have a website with different features, and you want to add or change these features without causing downtime for your users. Pioneer is a tool that helps you do that. It allows you to control features in your application by using feature flags. These flags act as switches that determine if a feature should be turned on or off. By toggling these flags, you can control which users see which features. Pioneer also provides a dashboard called Compass, where you can manage these feature flags easily. With Pioneer, you can gradually release new features, minimize downtime, and have more control over your application.

## Detailed Explanation

### Problem Statement

Adding new features to an application, particularly when migrating from a monolith to a microservices architecture, can be a complex and challenging process. Issues such as tightly coupled code, slow development, increased traffic, and availability problems can arise. Deployment of new code can be time-consuming, error-prone, and may cause application downtime. Traditional deployment approaches, such as slow but safe or quick but risky, have their disadvantages.

### Solution: Feature Flags and Canary Deployment Strategy

To address these challenges, the team proposes the use of feature flags as an alternative solution. Feature flags are switches or toggles that can be used to control the activation or deactivation of specific features in an application. They can be thought of as representing the active state of a microservice. By using feature flags, developers can toggle between different states without the need for additional infrastructure or load balancers.

The team introduces the canary deployment strategy, which involves routing a portion of the traffic to the new microservice deployment while keeping the original deployment running. This approach allows for efficient and flexible feature rollouts, minimizing interference with existing infrastructure, and providing granular control over the state of individual microservices.

### Overview of Pioneer

Pioneer is a self-hosted feature flag management tool specifically designed for small to medium-sized organizations transitioning from a monolith to a microservices architecture. It allows controlled feature rollouts without extensive configuration or additional infrastructure like load balancers. Pioneer consists of multiple components, including Compass, JetStream, and Scout, all running in a Docker network.

- Compass: Compass serves as the primary dashboard for managing feature flags. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, updating, and deleting feature flags, as well as toggling their states. Changes made in Compass are published to JetStream and received by Scout, enabling real-time updates without the need for application redeployment.

- JetStream: JetStream is a third-party message streaming service that facilitates communication between Compass and Scout. It ensures asynchronous, fault-tolerant messaging with guaranteed delivery.

- Scout: Scout acts as the distributor of flag data. It interfaces between Compass and the SDK embedded in a user's application. Scout distributes flag data to SDK clients through a persistent HTTP connection, allowing real-time updates without excessive network traffic.

### Feature Flags and Their Implementation

Feature flags can be thought of as key-value pairs, similar to a dictionary. The key represents the active state of a microservice, while the boolean value determines the flow control. Users can toggle feature flags and control which microservices are active based on their state.

In the user's application code, the SDK is embedded, and the flag's state is checked. Depending on the flag's state, the corresponding microservice or internal monolith code is executed. This allows for seamless switching between different states without the need for load balancers or additional deployed environments.

### Engineering Decisions and Challenges

During the development of Pioneer, the team made several key engineering decisions to balance benefits and trade-offs:

- Communication: The team chose to use server-sent events (SSE) for transmitting feature flag data from Pioneer to user applications. SSE provides persistent HTTP connections between the server and clients, allowing real-time communication of flag updates.

- Server-Side SDKs: Pioneer offers server-side SDKs in Node.js, Ruby, and Go, which can be installed in the user's application code. These SDKs evaluate flag data within conditional statements to determine code execution based on flag values.

- Transmission of Flag Data: Pioneer transmits the entire rule set as JSON objects to ensure all SDKs have the most up-to-date flag data. This prioritizes data accuracy while considering manageable data size.

- Self-Hosted Application: Pioneer is designed as a self-hosted application, allowing users to deploy it on their preferred infrastructure and fully customize it to their specific needs.

Throughout the development process, the team faced challenges such as coordinating tasks in a distributed team, configuring container-to-container communication within a Docker network, and designing SDKs for gradual feature releases and percentage-based rollouts.

### Future Work

The video concludes by discussing potential future developments for Pioneer. Some of the proposed enhancements include supporting multiple applications within a single instance of Pioneer, expanding rollout strategies to include targeting specific user segments, beta testers, or internal users, and implementing flag exploration to define clear testing or rollout windows for new features.

## Conclusion

Pioneer is a self-hosted feature flag management tool that helps organizations transition from a monolith to a microservices architecture. By using feature flags and the canary deployment strategy, Pioneer enables controlled feature rollouts, minimizes downtime, and provides granular control over microservices. The tool consists of various components, including Compass, JetStream, and Scout, and supports different programming languages through server-side SDKs. Throughout the development process, the team made key engineering decisions to optimize performance, flexibility, and user experience. Future work could involve expanding Pioneer's capabilities, such as supporting multiple applications and implementing more advanced rollout strategies.
