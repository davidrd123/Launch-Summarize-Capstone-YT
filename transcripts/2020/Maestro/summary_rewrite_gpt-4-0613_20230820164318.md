# Maestro: A Capstone Coding Project On Serverless Orchestration 

This capstone project is about **Maestro**, a framework designed to allow rapid iteration for serverless orchestration. 

## ELI5
Just like a maestro (or conductor) guides an orchestra, Maestro guides serverless functions to work together in harmony, making creating serverless applications easier, faster, and more efficient.

## The Tools Used
* AWS (Amazon Web Services) - mainly the AWS Lambda and AWS Step Functions services
* FaaS (Function as a Service) - a subset of serverless
* ASL (Amazon States Language) - a JSON-based, declarative language for describing states and transitions
* Node.js - for running the Maestro framework
* NPM (Node Package Manager) - for installing the Maestro package
* AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) - for managing roles and permissions  
* Other frameworks/tools mentioned or compared to are: AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM), AWS CloudFormation, Serverless Framework, and Step (by Coinbase)

## Serverless Explained
In a serverless architecture, developers offload application code to the cloud, eliminating the need to manage local servers, saving considerable amounts of time and money. Serverless includes a subset known as Function as a Service (FaaS), which is when small applications with a single responsibility, run on individual containers that can scale in response to events. AWS Lambda is currently the most popular cloud provider offering for FaaS, despite some limitations like a 15 minute execution time limit.

## Lambda and Orchestration Patterns
The developers discuss several challenges associated with working with Lambda like state management, cold starts, and limited visibility into system execution. To tackle these challenges, they also introduce orchestration patterns. Orchestration in this context refers to managing the workflow between multiple Lambda functions and other services. 

## AWS Step Functions - How It's Utilized
Maestro uses AWS Step Functions to define workflows using the Amazon States Language (ASL). ASL allows developers to define their applications as a mixture of inputs, states, and transitions. AWS Step Functions provides different types of states such as lambdas, choice states, and weight states. By integrating this capability, Maestro simplifies the organization and visualization of complex workflows.

## The Maestro Framework
Maestro stands out because it introduces a dedicated orchestration layer that separates business logic from orchestration logic, simplifying complex workflows. Right now Maestro supports only Node.js 12.x runtime for deployed lambdas, and does not support other AWS services like DynamoDB, SQS, EC2 or ECS.

## Development and Deployment with Maestro
With the Maestro framework, developers can create and deploy AWS resources much quicker compared to manually doing it through AWS console. Maestro even allows for fast teardown (removal) of resources. They do this by providing eight official templates that can bootstrap workflows. However, it currently lacks native support for other AWS services beyond AWS Lambda and AWS Step Functions.

## Current Limitations and Future Goals
The current version of Maestro is limited to supporting only Node.js 12.x runtime for deployed Lambdas and lacks native support for other key AWS services. But they aim to address these by expanding support to other AWS services and broaden Maestroâ€™s versatility in the future.

## Challenges Faced and Lessons Learned
During the development of Maestro, some challenges were faced such as understanding AWS IAM roles, and permissions, overcoming the issues with the propagation delays of newly created roles, and dealing with the asynchronous and concurrent nature of the processes. They also learned to innovate within a niche ecosystem of few frameworks specifically built for AWS Step Functions.

They concluded their project with readiness to accept questions, addressing some focused on the reasoning behind choosing AWS over other cloud services, the choice of terminology for 'orchestration', and dealing with dependencies and backoff rates for retries.
