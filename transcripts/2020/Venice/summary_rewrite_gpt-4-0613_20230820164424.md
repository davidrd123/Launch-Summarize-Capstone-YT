# Venice: A Framework for Generating Real-Time Event Processing Pipelines

## ELI5 Summary

Venice is like a super efficient post office for applications. It can take messages generated by parts of an application (known as 'events') and send them exactly where they need to go, in real-time. It's designed to be easy for smaller applications and developers to set up and use and it also makes sure that the messages are read in the right order and that none of them are lost along the way.

## Detailed Overview

Venice is a real-time event processing framework, designed to aid developers in deploying and managing their event streaming process. It utilizes open-source components to establish a pipeline in minutes, making real-time event processing accessible to developers with limited event streaming knowledge.

In modern-day applications, multiple services often require access to the same data. Sharing data across these services can lead to consistency issues and relaying updated information in real-time is a challenge. This is where Venice comes into play. With Venice, data updates are propagated through events, which are objects that describes a change in the application at a specific point in time. Venice utilizes log-based message brokers to process events and allows for real-time data propagation across services without compromising performance or scalability. 

## Tools Used 

### Languages and Technologies

- SQL/Syntax: KSQLDB uses a SQL-like syntax which is more comfortable for developers to use.

### Cloud Services

Not mentioned explicitly.

### Other Technologies 

- Event producers 
- Event consumers 
- Log-based message brokers for event propagation
- Streams processing engines to transform events
- Kafka 
- KSQLDB: Chosen as stream processor due to simplicity of use.
- Kafka Connect: Serves as an integration layer between Kafka and external data sources or sinks.
- Postgres: Used as a data sink.
- Schema Registry: Used to track changes in schemas and perform validation with stored schemas.
- Docker Containers: Packages each component for streamlining the installation process and resolving dependency conflicts.
- User Interface(UI) component - Calfdrop: It provides a visual representation of data flow through the system.


## Architecture

The architecture of Venice includes interconnected event producers, message brokers, stream processing engines, and event consumers. This system relies on Apache Kafka, a highly popular open-source log-based message broker. Apache Kafka allows for low latency and high throughput and ensures the availability and consistency of data. For stream processing, KSQLDB is used due to its SQL-like syntax and ease of use. Together, these components enable robust real-time event processing.

## Challenges 

During the development of Venice, two significant challenges were encountered:

- The complexity of linear event processing using logs. A single slow event can cause significant delays.
- Efficiently querying the event data in the desired format. Traditional querying methods can be slow and inefficient.
  
To handle these challenges, Venice introduced two concepts: the naive consumer model and the smart consumer model. These models separate the initial writing of event data from the reading process and employ stream processors to process events in real-time. This maximizes efficiency and performance.

## Conclusion 

Venice is a framework designed to enable developers to quickly deploy and manage their own event streaming process. It simplifies real-time event processing pipelines by utilizing various open-source technologies and introducing smart concepts to enhance performance. Venice is especially beneficial for smaller applications and developers new to event streaming.
