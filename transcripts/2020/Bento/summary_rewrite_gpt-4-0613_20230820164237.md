## Capstone Project: Bento

### Overview

This document provides a detailed analysis of the capstone project, Bento - a blazing fast, serverless video pipeline aimed at transformng the video transcoding process. Bento uses a serverless architecture built using Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) technology, designed to handle the growth of internet video content and the challenges related to storing, transferring, and transforming video data.

### ELI5 Summary

Video files are big and are difficult to send over the internet. There are a lot of devices and different ways to play video files. To ensure everyone can play a video, companies often have to create different versions of the same video. This is complex, resource-intensive, time-consuming, and costly, especially for businesses without extensive video expertise. Bento is a tool that simplifies this process, breaking down a video into smaller parts, making changes to each part at the same time (known as parallel processing), and then putting these parts back together again. By doing this, Bento can make these changes faster and cheaper than existing solutions.

### Tools Used

#### Cloud Services

1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Serves as the primary cloud service provider.
  - AWS Lambda: Most widely used function as a service platform. Basis for the serverless architecture.
  - AWS S3: Used for storing video files.
  - Amazon DynamoDB: Used for tracking pipeline state and storing information about user videos.
  - Amazon EC2: Hosts Bento's admin dashboard.

#### Languages

1. **JavaScript (Node.js Runtime)**: Used to write the functions in Bento.

#### Other Technologies

1. **FFmpeg**: A free, open-source software library used for handling multimedia data. Used by Bento for all multimedia file operations.

### Detailed Explanation

Video files make up around 79 percent of all internet traffic and pose several challenges when it comes to storage, memory, and bandwidth. These issues only increase as video resolution and frame rates improve. To deliver videos properly over the internet, businesses have to deal with compatibility and bandwidth issues which involve choosing correct video formats (codecs and containers) and compressing videos optimally. Video transcoding is a process that attempts to solve these challenges by transforming video files from one format to another. However, this process is resource-intensive and presents a bottleneck for those with regular video demands.

Bento attempts to solve these challenges through a serverless architecture in a FaaS model, delegating infrastructure management to a third party and allows businesses to pay only for the compute time used. Leveraging the FaaS model allows Bento to automatically scale up or down computing resources in line with workload requirements, providing optimal resource utilization and eliminating wasted capacity. 

Instead of working on a video file from start to finish (a linear process), Bento breaks down videos into smaller six-second segments which are then concurrently processed by the system, dramatically reducing the overall transcoding time and making the process significantly faster. These smaller segments are then combined again to form the original video but in a different desired format.

By providing a serverless video transcoding solution, Bento offers a fast and affordable video transcoding solution, particularly for businesses with intermittent video transcoding needs, without the need for a large-scale, dedicated setup or extensive video expertise.
