# Coding Capstone Project: River 

## Overview

River is a drop-in real-time service designed for web applications. Developed by Katrina and Mark, River is cloud-native, designed for easy deployment, and scales according to your needs. The project was designed with cloud-based technologies and concepts in mind, showcasing various design elements and architectural choices that make the service robust and user-friendly.

## Concept: Cloud-native

Being Cloud-native means that River has been specifically designed and built with cloud services in mind. Cloud computing brings with it a plethora of intriguing ideas, many of which have been explored during the creation and development of River.

## Project Scope

The scaffold of River is aimed at application developers and is inserted alongside existing applications to enhance their capabilities. The service primarily allows developers to publish real-time events from their backend APIs, which are then made available to web clients instantaneously.

## Goals of the Presentation

This presentation intends to introduce the concept of real-time in the context of web applications, dissect why a separate real-time service may be beneficial, illustrate how to add real-time functionality to an existing app using River, examine existing real-time solutions, and finally explore the construction of River and the automation of its deployment.

## Core Concepts: Real-time and WebSockets

Real-time, in the context of web applications, pertains to the rapid exchange of messages. Latency tolerance differs depending on the sensitivity of the application to delays. To facilitate the fast exchange of messages, River uses WebSockets over HTTP, primarily because of their reduced metadata overhead and their support for bi-directional communication.

## Real-time Functionality in Application

The application of real-time functionality in a simple forum application was demonstrated by publishing new updates to a channel (representing a forum), and subscribers to that channel (users) receive real-time updates of the new posts. River doesn't modify the HTTP communication paths of an application. Instead, it introduces a cost-effective browser-facing publish-subscribe model that boosts functionality and simplifies communication and has flexible subscription-based interactions. 

## Existing Real-Time Solutions

Other current real-time solutions include open-source libraries such as Socket.IO and commercial services like Pusher. Though effective, some of these solutions could entail additional complexities during set up and scaling, while commercial options can become costly for high-traffic applications. Pertaining to this, River was developed as an open-source alternative to services like Pusher, focusing on being easy to deploy and ready to scale.

## Design & Technology stack

River is built as a Node.js process running a WebSocket server. It was initially deployed within an EC2 instance (part of Amazon Web Services), but this was later extended to multiple EC2 instances to allow for horizontal scaling and added robustness. To handle inter-node communication, Amazon's Elasticache for Redis service was used, and an Application Load Balancer was added to manage client traffic. To separate WebSocket and HTTP communications, a backchannel via API Gateway service was used. For ease of deployment and use, River was containerized and migrated to Amazon's Elastic Container Service (ECS).

## Future Improvements

Future plans for River include automation of secure websockets initialization, leveraging Amazon Web Services' Cognito service for stronger security and implementation of a feature that allows dropped connections to resume through accessing River's cache of recent messages.

## Conclusion & Summary

River provides an intuitive and robust solution for enhancing existing web applications with real-time communication. With focus on easy deployment and security, the developers hope that River will prove to be a valuable tool for other developers looking to add real-time functionality to their applications.

## Simple Explanation (ELI5)

River is a tool that helps make web applications quicker and more interactive. It allows updates to be sent to the users instantly, without them having to refresh their webpage. This capability can make apps like online chat rooms, collaborative documents, or live data dashboards much more user-friendly.
