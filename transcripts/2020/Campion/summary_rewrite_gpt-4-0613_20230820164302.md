# Capstone Project Video Analysis: Kampkin 

## Introduction

The Capstone project discussed in this transcript revolves around the development and application of "Kampkin" - a unique framework designed to allow applications to fail faster and better. Failing efficiently in software systems means identifying and addressing issues promptly, thus enhancing overall system resilience.

## ELI5

Put simply, Kampkin is like a traffic controller for a city of interconnected services (microservices architecture). When it finds a roadblock (one service failing), it can quickly redirect traffic to avoid a citywide traffic jam. Also, it keeps an eye on the roadwork (failed services) and only allows traffic to flow again when it's safe.

## Overview of Tools Used

* Monolith and Microservices Architectures: Fundamental architectural approaches in application development.
* HTTP Protocol: A communication protocol used by services in a microservice architecture.
* Synchronous and Asynchronous Communications: Different ways services can interact with one another.
* Michael Nygard's "Release It": A book that introduced and popularized the Circuit Breaker pattern.
* Cloudflare and Amazon: Kampkin utilizes services from both these major cloud providers.
* Command Line Tool: To handle operations like deploying a circuit breaker.
* In-Browser Front-End App: A user-friendly interface to manage Kampkin's configurations.

## Detailed Explanation

### Microservice Architecture and Its Challenges

At the start of the development phase, engineers often use a monolith architecture where the application's entire functionality resides in a single codebase. However, as the application grows, this approach tends to be less scalable, leading to the adoption of a microservices architecture.

Microservices architecture divides the codebase into loosely coupled services, each with a specific responsibility. These services communicate over a network using protocols like HTTP. While this architecture provides benefits like scalability and independent deployments, it also presents challenges, particularly concerning communication latency and potential service failures.

### Addressing System Failures and Implementing Circuit Breakers

System failures are inevitable in microservices and can cause cascading problems, potentially leading to the failure of multiple services. To handle these issues, the key strategies the team implemented are as follows:

1. Incorporating timeout components in each synchronous request.
2. Tracking failure frequency.
3. Isolating failed services to allow recovery.
4. Logging failure information for in-depth system health analysis.

The core solution is the "Circuit Breaker" design pattern, which combines the above strategies. Much like an electrical circuit, this switch opens and severs connections when there is a detected failure, providing an effective strategy for mitigating these issues. The circuit breaker pattern helps enhance system resilience by containing and isolating failures, thereby preventing cascading failures.

### Flow of The Circuit Breaker Pattern

The pattern works by monitoring the status and response time of each request during normal operation. If a request fails and the number of consecutive failures exceeds a user-defined threshold, the circuit breaker opens, severing the connection. It stays open for a cooldown period, during which incoming requests are immediately returned with a failure response.

Once the cooldown period expires, it transitions to a half-open state where a limited number of test requests are allowed through to assess the service's health. If the tests succeed, the circuit breaker closes; if they fail, it returns to the open state, resetting the cooldown.

### Loosely-Coupled Circuit Breaker Implementations

Libraries and service meshes are two ways to implement the circuit breaker mechanism. However, Kampkin's team implemented it as middleware deployed on a content distribution network (CDN) using edge compute, reducing request time and ensuring fast responses.

Using Cloudflare and Amazon, they developed Campion, their implementation of the circuit breaker middleware. For example, in Cloudflare Workers, the circuit breaker code is deployed on a worker, checking the worker's KV (a CDN database) to determine the circuit state before routing the request.

### Introducing Campion

Campion is a middleware circuit breaker deployed at the edge, complete with a command-line tool & a front-end application for ease of deployment and management. It can be deployed on either Amazon (Lambda Edge) or Cloudflare (Workers). Both have their trade-offs concerning deployment time, replication speed, and user ecosystem preferences.

Campion, as placeholder middleware, has negligible latency concerns and offers simplicity, reusability, and ease of deployment. The middleware circuit breaker is helpful with smaller companies and suitable for front-end web apps and external APIs. It provides a central place to manage all circuit breaker settings and endpoints, and offers insightful metrics about the state of your services.

### Summary 

In summary, Kampkin and its core component, "Campion," is an excellent tool to preserve service resilience in a microservices architecture by effectively managing system failures. Its standout features include ease of application, compatibility with key platforms (Cloudflare & Amazon), scalability, and a comprehensive, easy-to-use interface. While Kampkin has demonstrated excellent ability, the team also noted areas for potential future enhancements, such as increased GUI capabilities and additional features for the front-end application.
