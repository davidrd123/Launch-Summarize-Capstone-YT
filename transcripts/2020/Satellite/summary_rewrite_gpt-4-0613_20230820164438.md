# Transcript Analysis - Satellite: A GraphQL Backend as a Service 

## Summary 

Satellite is a GraphQL Backend as a Service (BaaS). It simplifies the application development process for front-end developers by managing various tasks such as SSL configurations, static front-end hosting, and database setup, enabling them to focus on the GraphQL functionality. This is a self-hosted, open-source solution, which means it provides more flexibility and control to developers and avoids vendor lock-in common with managed services.

## ELI5 Summary 
In simple terms, consider Satellite like a chef's helper. Developers are chefs. They want to cook a great meal (build an amazing application) but dealing with all the prepping, cutting, and cleaning can be time-intensive and not their strong suit. Satellite steps in as a helpful sous chef. It handles all those backend tasks, so developers can focus on the main task of crafting a beautiful, functional application.

## Specific Tools Used 

1. **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs, acts as a communication channel between the front-end and back-end.

2. **Dgraph:** A graph database used as the data store for the Satellite application.

3. **Nginx:** A web server that serves static files and routes incoming requests.

4. **Node.js and Express:** The app server handles the application's business logic, such as uploading GraphQL schema, processing and fulfilling requests for dynamic data like administrative actions, and static file uploading.

5. **Kubernetes:** Used to orchestrate Docker containers and manage distribution of individual components of a Satellite across multiple machines.

6. **Docker and Docker Compose:** Used for containerization to package and isolate applications with their dependencies. This makes the deployment easier and efficient.

7. **Traffic:** An HTTP reverse proxy used to route external requests to the correct Satellite instances.

8. **React:** Used in building the admin panel for managing individual Satellite instances.

# Detailed Analysis and Explanation

## Architecture 

Application architecture consists of two parts: the front-end and the back-end. The front-end interacts with users, and the back-end manages business logic and data. They communicate via an API, allowing them to work independently and facilitating multiple front-end clients' development using the same back-end. The back-end typically follows a three-tier architecture â€“ with a web server as an entry point serving static files, an app server handling business logic, and a database for data persistence.

## GraphQL

GraphQL is an API for front-end developers developed by Facebook. It allows front-end clients to specify the exact information they need from back-end, thereby avoiding over-fetching and unnecessary round trips. They designed it to enhance network performance and offer a strongly typed system, enabling clients to use introspection to understand the API's capabilities.

## Using GraphQL for Back-end Development

Building a functional GraphQL back-end involves implementing a GraphQL server with two main components - schema and resolvers. The schema defines the API's functionality in terms of types and fields. The resolvers are functions that instruct the server on how to respond to requests. Together, these form the basis of a GraphQL API. 

## Backend as a Service (BaaS)

Backend as a Service solutions provide developers an abstraction over standard back-end components, alongside pre-configured features accessible via an API. This simplifies the back-end management tasks and enables developers to focus on front-end development more efficiently. 

There are two categories of BaaS solutions: managed services and open-source products. Unlike managed services, which are often proprietary and not always GraphQL-specific, open-source options offer more control and flexibility but may challenge setting and using.

## The Case for Satellite

Satellite is an open-source, self-hosted BaaS solution created specifically for GraphQL applications. Its primary aim is to simplify back-end management tasks for front-end developers. However, Satellite does not come with built-in user authentication, although integration with external tools is an option.

## Development Use Case for Satellite

Satellite is ideal for development teams needing a sandbox environment for front-end developers. Once a system administrator deploys it, each back-end created by front-end developers can host a different front-end application.

## Satellite: System Component

Satellite's architecture involves several interacting components. It uses an Nginx web server to serve static files and route incoming requests, a Node.js Express application server to process administrative actions, and Dgraph as a data store.

## Employing Docker for Deployment

Given the need to deploy several components comprising Satellite, Docker was used for containerization. It offers an isolated, consistent way of packaging applications and their dependencies. Docker Compose is used for defining and running these multi-container Docker applications.

## Satellite Architecture - Multiple Instances

To accommodate multiple applications or versions of the same application, Satellite offers a multi-instance architecture. It uses Kubernetes for the distribution of components of a single Satellite across several machines to manage and avoid possible port name and network conflicts.

## Routing and Admin Panel 

External requests are routed to the appropriate Satellite instance using Traffic as a reverse proxy. An admin panel built using React is offered to simplify individual Satellite management. It allows front-end developers to perform administrative actions on their Satellite instances. 

## Creating an Application with Satellite

A To-Do App was built as a part of the presentation to showcase how to utilize the Satellite instance to build a fully functional application. The developers uploaded a schema and front-end files to be served by the Nginx container within the Satellite instance. 

## Future Improvements

Future improvements for Satellite include the implementation of an authentication mechanism, enhanced satellite management capabilities, providing a way to keep track of API metrics and loads, as well as facilitating easy database backups and imports.
