# Stagehand: The Front-end Application Review App

## ELI5 Summary

Imagine for a moment that you are an artist working on a large canvas. You and your team are using different colors and brushes to make the painting look beautiful. However, before putting it on display, you would like to see how each stroke impacts the overall appearance of the painting. This is where Stagehand comes in. It gives you a miniature version of your painting (your code) on a smaller canvas (an app). These miniature versions are called review apps, which serve as a platform where you can examine and validate the features before finalizing the painting.

## What is Stagehand?

Stagehand is an open-source software framework designed to automate and simplify the staging and review process of front-end applications before they go into production. Named after the stagehands in theatre who create and manage the stage for the performers, this software aids developers to efficiently manage, review, and showcase their changes or features through review apps. By utilizing Stagehand, developers are essentially given the control and flexibility over their application as in a do-it-yourself approach but with the convenience of automation.

## Tools and Components Used

## Chain Blocks (Primary Tools)

- **AWS Cloud Infrastructure:** Used for hosting and server space needs, making use of services like S3 for storing access files and CloudFront for handling HTTP requests.
- **GitHub Actions:** A GitHub service used for automating software workflow commands, enabling developers to build, test, and deploy their projects on GitHub.
- **Client-Side Code:** Code that executes on the user's web browser, managing the user interface and enabling user interaction.

### Specific Tools Within Each Chain Block

- **S3 Buckets:** AWS S3 provides object storage through a web service interface and is used here to store assets for the review apps.
- **CloudFront:** AWS's Content Delivery Network (CDN) – used to speed up the distribution of static and dynamic web content.
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** AWS service for controlling resource access
- **CloudFormation:** AWS service that allows developers to automate infrastructure setup and teardown.
- **GitHub Server:** Used to run code within repositories to avoid the need for an external server.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Utilized to manage Stagehand apps, interacting with users through lines of text.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Standard front-end technology stack to handle client-side scripting and implement user interfaces.
- **Node/npm:** Stagehand CLI is a Node/npm package.
- **Service Workers:** Scripts that allow handling of network requests and cache resources in complex ways. Intercept requests and responses in Stagehand to handle routing.
- **Frameworks supported:** Stagehand apps are capable of supporting various modern front-end framewords like React, Gatsby, Hugo, and Next.js.

## Walkthrough of the Capstone Project

The team named 'Stachan, consisting of Cody, Daniel and Emil' showcase their project, Stagehand, which they divided into three core components; AWS services, GitHub Actions, and client-side code.

AWS is used to provide review apps on request, fetching app assets from S3 where they are stored. This, they explain, reduces the load on the primary application, making the delivery of review app a swift process. GitHub Actions, meanwhile, automatically deploys review apps when a pull request is deployed, generating unique URL for each app, which can then be shared for review. Following approval and a merge to the master branch, these apps are removed to free up resources. The client-side aspect creates a dashboard view, providing an interface for users to review apps.

Stagehand operates on a system that rests between automated platforms like Netlify and Heroku, and a DIY approach, offering the convenience of automation but with the control and customization of a self-built system. It's noted, however, that like any trade-off, Stagehand’s flexibility comes at the expense of not being feature-rich out of the box, similar to hosted solutions.

Daniel, a team member, takes viewers through a demo showcasing the simplicity of Stagehand. He showcases the process of setting up a repository, creating a pull request, automatically generating a review app, and displaying it through a unique URL. This review process was aimed to provide a simplified, streamlined, and collaborative approach to code review in a team context.

The team overcame technical challenges involved in handling relative paths in the application's assets and updating the URL of the main window. These were mitigated by the use of service worker and continuous polling, respectively. They also plan on creating dashboard templates for specific use cases, extending their solution to non-AWS cloud providers, providing an option for self-hosted GitHub runners, and creating an automated test suite in the future. 

Overall, the Stachan team presented a unique, open-source solution for managing review apps and streamlining the process of development to deployment for modern front-end applications.
