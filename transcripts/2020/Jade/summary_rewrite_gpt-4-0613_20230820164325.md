# Project Overview

This Capstone project revolves around the Jade Framework, an open-source deployment environment for Jamstack applications and covers the basics of the Jamstack architecture, explores different web app architectures, and how Jade offers an alternative and efficient approach. 

## ELI5 Summary for the Jade Framework

Imagine if you want to send a letter to a friend who lives in a different city. The traditional way would be to post it and wait for the postal services to deliver it. What if you could get a duplicate of your friend, living in your city, and hand deliver your letter directly? This is what the Jade Framework does for web apps. Instead of having users request web content (the letter) from a database server (the friend in a different city), Jade builds a complete, static version of the web page (the duplicate friend in your city) in advance. This makes delivery (showing the web page) much faster.

## Particular Tools Used
1. AWS (EC2 Instances, AWS Lambda, S3 Buckets, CloudFront) 
2. GitHub for version control 
3. Docker for creating containerized environments for build processes 
4. Node.js server for routing
5. Nginx reverse proxy
6. JavaScript for client-side backend logic along with APIs and Markup for the JAM stack architecture
7. Hugo, Jekyll, or Gatsby for static site generation
8. NoSQL AWS DynamoDB for storing user configurations
9. Express.js for spinning up a local server
10. React for building the Admin Dashboard

# Detailed Explanation

## Introduction
This presentation elaborates on the Jade Framework, a deployment environment for Jamstack applications. It explores the benefits of using prebuilt pages, serverless functions, and Distributed Network Services (CDNs). It will unpack the build and deployment workflow of the Jade Framework and how it provides a seamless and automated process.

## Jamstack Architecture

Jamstack, through prebuilding pages, reduces the number of requests a client makes to the server, boosting page load speed and minimizing client-side rendering. It enables the use of a static site generator such as Hugo, Jekyll, or Gatsby instead of the typical client-server model of sending requests and waiting for responses. A static site generator compiles, minifies, transforms, and bundles source code to create web pages before runtime. Consequently, it enables web pages to be served directly to the client upon request, which significantly reduces load times.

To serve users with the most updated content and enhance security, serverless functions are employed. Instead of having the server accessing the database for dynamic content such as comments, serverless functions help in retrieving this data. These can serve many purposes, like authentication, form handling, and event processing.

## Jade Framework

Using Jade Framework, a version control system like GitHub, Bitbucket, or CodeCommit, it's possible to set up automated builds when a webhook detects an event like a commit or merge, directly leading to the build server. This server then handles the pre-building process by fetching the updated code and compiling it.

After the pre-building stage is complete, the built files are uploaded to storage while ensuring the files are all or none (atomic deploys) with no partial builds. The next step is to invalidate the CDN after successfully uploading the files. The CDN cache is invalidated using a service function. This reflects the changes and pushes the updated content to the CDN for all users to access the latest version.

As an application for the Jade Framework, JaaS or Jamstack as a Service is introduced. It manages the process of building and deploying so that developers only have to write the code.

Furthermore, Jade Framework also provides an admin panel, a friendly interface to manage the builds and deployment for developers to preview changes before pushing updates.

Given how it exploits popular technologies in the industry, the Jade Framework does provide an efficient, alternative solution to building and deploying Jamstack applications for developers.
