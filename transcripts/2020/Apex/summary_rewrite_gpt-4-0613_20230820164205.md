# Capstone Project Summary: Apex API Proxy

## Introduction
Apex is an application programming interface (API) that proxies and is designed to manage and control traffic between microservices. This Capstone project revolves around the development, implementation, and management of Apex.

## 1. Microservices and Monolithic Architecture
- **Monolithic Architecture:** In this architecture, all the software components of an application are assembled together and tightly packaged. An example of this is an e-commerce app where all the component logic resides within a single application server which interacts with a database and communicates with the client.

- **Microservices Architecture:** In this type of architecture, software applications are broken down into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other using APIs. These services are autonomous and develop separately from one another. 

## 2. Challenges with Microservices
Microservices introduce several challenges, predominantly linked to network-based communication. These include: 

- Diagnosing network faults: It can be cumbersome to identify the source of a network failure within a microservices architecture because each service logs and stores its operations independently.
- Managing fault handling logic: Network faults can be unpredictable, necessitating services to handle retries. Defining reliable retry logic is vital to prevent overwhelming or crashing the services. 

## 3. Existing solutions: API Gateway and Service Mesh
The challenges of microservice architectures can be mitigated using solutions like the API Gateway and the Service Mesh.

- **API Gateway:** Serves as a single entry point to a system and abstracts the internal architecture's complexity. The API Gateway receives requests and forwards them to the appropriate services based on predefined rules.
- **Service Mesh:** Utilizes multiple proxy servers to improve communication between services. This architecture allows for seamless and reliable communication between services while decoupling services from network intricacies.

## 4. Design and Architecture of Apex
Apex is an API proxy that stands as a solution to the challenges encountered in microservice architectures. It serves as a centralized entry point, logging and controlling traffic in the system.

Two primary components make up the architecture of Apex:

- **Gateway Manager:** Manages the configuration and lifecycle of the Gateway Instances.
- **Gateway Instances:** These are the actual proxy servers that manage incoming requests and outgoing responses.

## 5. Implementation and Deployment of Apex
The Gateway Manager and Instances form a central part of the implementation of Apex. The Gateway Manager serves as the control plane, responsible for managing the configuration and state of the Gateway Instances, while the Gateway Instances act as the data plane, handling the demands of the network traffic.

The deployment of Apex entails setting up the Gateway Instances alongside the microservices they handle, while the Gateway Manager is deployed separately to manage the configuration and coordination of these Instances.

Apex faced several challenges during implementation, including ensuring seamless integration with various microservices implemented in different technologies and languages.

## 6. Concluding Remarks 
Apex offers a proactive solution to managing communication between microservices in a microservices architecture. It provides a reliable, scalable, and high-performance solution despite the challenges encountered, making it an excellent tool for developers working with microservices.

## ELI5 Summary
Apex is like a traffic cop managing the flow of data between different pieces of software (microservices) in a big project. Apex makes sure that these tiny pieces of software (think of them like different teams in a football match) can talk to each other efficiently.

Even if many challenges arise, Apex tries to overcome them by supervising the traffic, and maintaining logs, so if anything goes wrong, we know exactly where to look!
