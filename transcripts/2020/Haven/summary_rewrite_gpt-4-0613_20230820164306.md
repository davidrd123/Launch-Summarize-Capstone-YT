# Introduction

In this video, the speaker's team introduces Haven, an open-source system designed for secrets management. "Secrets" are sensitive data that authenticate or authorize system access and effect actions within it, often as connection strings for databases or API tokens for cloud providers. However, they must be safely managed and protected against unauthorized access to protect the system. The concept of secrets differs from sensitive data like credit card information - it explicitly involves data that directly authorize or authenticate system access. 

# Problem Statement 

Given the capture of unauthorized secrets can lead to breaches or costly errors, the speaker touches on the challenges and limitations of secret management. Common approaches mean secrets can often be hard-coded into the app, stored in environment variables, or even encrypted - all these solutions, however, lack structure and are prone to misuse. They can also inadvertently proliferate in different locations and formats - an issue known as "secret sprawl". For example, they can be sent between developers over insecure communication channels like Slack or scattered across infrastructure (CI tools, databases, etc.), making them hard to track and control. 

# Haven's Solution

Haven offers a centralized, secure platform to manage secrets, hiding complexity in the backend so developers can focus on utilizing the secrets they need without worrying about security. Coupled with best practices and existing solutions, Haven decreases secret sprawl and enhances security without hindering accessibility.

# Tools Used

Haven's architecture utilizes several AWS (Amazon Web Services) products to keep secrets safe, including: 

- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM): managing permissions and defining secret access.  
- AWS Key Management Service (KMS): creating and storing a master key for encryption/decryption.
- AWS Lambda: A serverless function platform to enforce credential validity. 
- DynamoDB: A NoSQL database for storing secrets, logs, and other metadata. 
- AWS CloudFormation: Used to codify AWS infrastructure.

# ELI5 Summary

Imagine you have a bunch of keys that open doors to different parts of a big building (these keys are your secrets). Now, you could just leave these keys lying around and anyone could pick them up, or you could just hand them out to anyone who asks. In both cases, this can lead to people getting into rooms they're not supposed to be in, or misplacing a key and causing trouble. This is what programmers deal with when they need to hand out secrets in their software.

This team has made a big safe box called Haven where they store all the keys in one place (this is known as centralizing your secrets). Now, instead of people possibly losing their keys or getting into rooms they shouldn't be in, Haven knows who has what keys and can even change the locks if a key is lost. This way, it's much harder for a sneaky thief or well-meaning but clumsy janitor to cause any problems.

Key Technologies: 

- AWS 
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
- AWS Lambda
- DynamoDB
- AWS CloudFormation

These are all services that help Haven to store the keys (secrets) securely, keep track of who has what keys, and change the locks if needed.
