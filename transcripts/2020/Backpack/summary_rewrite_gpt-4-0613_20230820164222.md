# Backpack: A Portable Backend for Web Applications

## ELI5 Summary
Backpack is like a pop-up tent for your web applications. Instead of having to build a home ground up, Backpack offers a fully-equipped living space where you can focus on decorating. Similarly, Backpack offers a pre-packaged backend so that developers don't have to set up and configure servers, databases, and APIs each time. They can right away start working on their projects. The "tent", or backend, is portable, reusable and customizable.

## Project Details

Backpack is a Backend as a Service (BaaS) solution designed to simplify the process of backend development by providing built-in tools and services necessary for most web applications. It takes care of user authentication, file storage, data persistence, and real-time communication, thereby enabling developers to focus on building the frontend of their applications.

The Capstone project aimed at enhancing the scalability, flexibility, and ease of use of Backpack by implementing a multi-instance architecture using Docker, transitioning from a single-instance deployment, and developing an admin panel for managing each Backpack instance.

## Conceptual Components
- **Backend as a Service (BaaS)**: A service that provides ready-to-use backend functionality for web and mobile applications, allowing developers to focus on building the user interface.
- **Frontend** : The part of the application that users interact with. 
- **Backend** : The part of the application that processes and stores data.

## Technical Components
- **Docker Containers**: Docker enables the packaging of the entire setup (Backpack core app, MongoDB server, etc.) into a container for easy deployment.
- **BaaS architecture**: Consists of frontend and backend interacting through API endpoints. 
- **Backpack SDK**: Offers developers pre-made methods to interact with backend API.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for data management in Backpack.

## Implementation
The project started by implementing a **single-instance** deployment of Backpack. Using **Docker containers**, multiple services like the Backend app, MongoDB server, and an Admin Panel were encapsulated into a self-contained environment. The abstraction enabled by Docker containers made it easy to set up and deploy the Backpack instance anywhere.

Transiting from a single-instance to **multi-instance architecture**, the project used **Docker Swarm** to handle the orchestration of multiple Docker containers. Furthermore, to manage multiple Backpack instances, an **Admin Panel** was created. It allowed system admins to set up, monitor, and tear down Backpack instances easily.

## Tools/Technologies Used
- Docker and Docker Swarm: To package and manage Backpack instances. 
- API: To access backend services.
- SDK (Software Development Kit): For interacting with backend.
- MongoDB: For data persistence.
- JavaScript and Mongoose module: For enforcing predefined schemas.
- Node.js: Server runtime environment.
- NoSQL: For flexible data structuring.
- Websockets: For real-time communication.
- Traffic: For serving as a reverse proxy.
- Redis: For session caching. 
- Postgres: For storing admin user information.
- NGINX: For front-end hosting.
