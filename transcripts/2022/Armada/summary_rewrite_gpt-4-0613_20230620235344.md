# Detailed Analysis

## Project Overview
In this video, a group of developers presents their capstone project "Armada". Armada is an open-source container orchestration tool designed to streamline and automate the configuration and deployment of developer environments in cloud settings, with a primary focus on education. Here's a closer look at what they discuss:

### What problems does Armada address? 
Setting up developer environments can be challenging due to configuration overload, dependency management, and a lack of resource availability. To alleviate these problems, Armada automates environment setup, handles dependencies, and optimizes resources.

### Exploration of existing solutions
The team compares existing solutions like Coder, Gitpod, and GitHub CodeSpace, showcasing their pros and cons. Armada aims to improve these solutions by providing better ease of use, seamless integration with surrounding systems, and lower cost, especially for educational institutions.

### Armada's Creation 
The development of Armada is split into eight key milestones: the creation of a workspace container, the establishment of cloud infrastructure, deploying one workspace, and then multiple workspaces, creation of URLs for each workspace, saving data, managing data, implementing a user interface, and user authentication.

### Demo Videos
Two demo videos are shown to exhibit how an instructor can manage students, cohorts, courses, and workspaces through the Armada app and how students can access their workspace via a simplified dashboard.

## ELI5 Summary
Think of Armada as a really efficient traffic controller for coding. There's a lot of different parts to coding - like managing all the instructions and making sure everything works together. Armada helps with all of this so that students can focus on learning how to code, and teachers can focus on teaching - rather than getting stuck on managing everything else.

## Specific Tools and Technologies Used

1. AWS (Amazon Web Services): Cloud services for infrastructure management, scalability, and data persistence.
   - EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
   - ECS (Elastic Container Services)
   - S3 Buckets
   - SDK (Software Development Kit)
   - CDK (Cloud Development Kit)
   - EBS (Elastic Block Store) 
   - EFS (Elastic File System)
   - AWS Lambda
   - AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)
   - AWS Cognito
2. Docker: Used for the creation and management of application containers.
3. Nginx: Used to make the workspace accessible over the web.
4. Kubernetes: Explored for container orchestration.
5. Docker Swarm: Explored for container orchestration.
6. Gitpod: Explored for coding environment.
7. Coder(code server): Used for coding environment.
8. GitHub CodeSpaces: Explored for coding environments.
9. TypeScript and Express: Used for backend development of the Armada app.
10. Virtualization: Used for creating an abstraction layer over hardware to enable easier distribution and manageability of resources. 
11. Containerization: Used for optimizing virtual environments. 
12. Load Balancing applications (ALB): For managing incoming user traffic and ensure efficient resource utilization.
13. PostgresSQL: Initially considered for database management.
14. Visual Studio Code (VS Code): For code development. 
15. Other Potential tools: Terraform considered as an alternative to CDK.
