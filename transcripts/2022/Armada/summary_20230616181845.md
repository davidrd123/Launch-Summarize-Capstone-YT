# Coding Capstone Project Analysis

## Introduction
The video transcript is of a coding Capstone project presentation focused on Armada, an open-source container orchestration tool. Armada allows administrators to automate the configuration and deployment of developer environments in the cloud. The team of four members, Natalie Martos, Sergio Pachado, Joey Gilliam, and Dean Elizardo, worked on developing Armada over several months and shared their experiences and challenges in the presentation.

The presentation covers various aspects, including the problems Armada solves, the target audience in the education space, the process of virtualization, cloud environments, existing solutions, development challenges faced, and future plans for Armada.

## Problems Addressed
The team focuses on three key challenges faced by developers and students: configuration overload, dependency management, and resource availability. Configuration overload refers to the complexity and time-consuming nature of setting up multiple environments with different configurations. Dependency management becomes a challenge due to the interdependencies between different packages and libraries used in modern applications. Resource availability refers to the need for significant computational resources, which can be costly for students and organizations.

## Armada in Education Space
The team recognizes the specific challenges faced by students and instructors in the education space. Students often struggle with environment configuration and dependency management, which can be overwhelming and impact their motivation. Instructors also face difficulties in managing different hardware configurations, software, and experience levels of their students.

Armada aims to provide easy-to-use development environments for students, simplify workspace management for instructors, scale based on demand, and minimize costs.

## Virtualization and Cloud Environments
Virtualization is introduced as a technique that uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware. This allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single host machine, each with its own operating system. Virtualization provides the ability to create snapshots of VMs, allowing for easy restoration to a specific state. This technique can be used to provide consistent development environments for students.

Cloud environments, specifically third-party services, are introduced as a solution to abstract away hardware management and maintenance. Cloud environments provide on-demand access to networking and computational resources, allowing for scalability based on demand. Armada leverages cloud environments to provide scalable and efficient developer environments.

## Existing Solutions and Armada's Approach
The presentation discusses three popular existing solutions in the market: Coder, Gitpod, and GitHub CodeSpaces. These solutions primarily target software developers and not students or instructors learning and teaching software engineering. The team identifies the need for a solution specifically tailored to the education space, leading to the development of Armada.

Armada aims to provide an easy-to-use, low-cost option exclusively for education, bridging the gap between student needs and instructor requirements.

## Armada Architecture Milestones

### Containerization and Provisioning Cloud Infrastructure
The team starts with containerizing workspaces using a base image called `code-server`. They choose Amazon Web Services (AWS) as their cloud provider and utilize the Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) service to provision virtual servers to host the containers.

### Deploying and Managing Single Workspaces
Initially, single containers are deployed to EC2 instances, but this approach is not scalable. The team explores container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). Ultimately, they choose ECS as it is cloud-native, integrates well with other AWS services, and offers a low learning curve.

### Deploying Multiple Workspaces and Scalability
The team moves from individual tasks to ECS services to manage multiple workspaces. ECS services provide automation, monitoring, and scalability to individual tasks. They leverage ECS service scaling and EC2's auto scaling groups to dynamically manage resource allocation and capacity.

### Routing and Load Balancing
The team introduces an application load balancer (ALB) in front of the ECS cluster to efficiently route traffic to multiple workspaces. They utilize dynamic port mapping and configure ALB target groups to ensure traffic is directed to the correct workspace based on the path of the request.

### Persisting Workspace Data with Elastic File System (EFS)
To address data persistence, the team explores Amazon's Elastic Block Storage (EBS) and Elastic File System (EFS). After considering the drawbacks of EBS, they choose EFS as it provides serverless file storage with on-demand scalability. They utilize AWS Lambda functions to create and manage directories within EFS.

### Armada App Backend and User Authentication
The team develops the Armada app using Express and TypeScript as the backend. They leverage AWS SDK to interact with various AWS resources, AWS Cognito for user authentication, and Amazon RDS for database management. The Armada app allows instructors to manage and deploy workspaces, students to access their workspaces, and provides user authentication and authorization.

## Future Plans for Armada
The team outlines future plans, including creating a one-click deployment via AWS CloudFormation, integrating with GitHub repositories, implementing collaboration features, and optimizing costs by implementing measures such as spinning down ECS services when containers are not in use.

## ELI5 Summary
Armada is a tool that helps students and instructors easily manage and access their coding environments. It solves problems such as setting up complex configurations, managing dependencies, and accessing computational resources. The team built Armada to work in the cloud, allowing students to have their own virtual machines with all the necessary tools, while instructors can easily manage and scale these environments. Armada simplifies the process of learning and teaching coding, saving time and reducing frustrations.
