# Analysis of Coding Capstone Project Video Transcript

## Introduction
The video is a presentation of a coding Capstone project called Artemis. The project is developed by a fully remote team with members across four different cities and three disparate time zones. The team introduces themselves and explains that Artemis is an open-source serverless framework for scalable load testing of APIs.

## Key Terminology
The team starts by defining some key terms related to load testing. Load testing is the process of simulating the usage of an application, website, or collection of interconnected resources to test their behavior under user-defined conditions. In the context of API load testing, it involves simulating raw network requests to measure the performance of a system without regard to the graphical user interface. A load testing tool is used to generate load by simulating virtual users that perform requests against the API being tested. The results of the load test are then analyzed based on specific metrics such as total requests made, average requests per second, request duration, and request failures.

## Importance of Load Testing APIs
The team explains that load testing APIs is important because API calls make up a significant portion of network traffic, with API call traffic growing faster than browser-based web traffic. For companies whose APIs are their primary product, it is crucial to ensure high availability and performance. Load testing allows for the identification of errors, bugs, and bottlenecks before deployment and helps verify the assumptions made about the performance of an organization's infrastructure.

## Existing Load Testing Tools
The team provides a quick demo of an existing load testing tool called k6, which is an open-source load testing tool written in Go. They explain that k6 allows users to write load test scripts in JavaScript and provides functionality for creating API load testing scenarios. The demo shows how a load test script is executed, and the resulting metrics are visualized.

## Challenges with Existing Load Testing Solutions
The team discusses the limitations of using local load testing tools, such as limited load generation due to CPU and memory constraints, lack of real-time results visualization, and the need to process and visualize test results manually. They also highlight the limitations of cloud-based load testing tools, including cost restrictions, tiered pricing models, and limited scalability.

## Introduction to Artemis
Artemis is introduced as an open-source serverless framework for scalable load testing of APIs. It leverages k6 as the load testing tool and provides infrastructure deployment, test execution, result visualization, and long-term data storage capabilities. Artemis aims to provide a flexible and scalable solution for users who cannot build a dedicated local testing environment or find cloud-based solutions too restrictive or costly.

## Overview of Artemis Architecture
The team presents an overview of the four main components of Artemis: load generation, data aggregation, data storage, and result visualization. They describe how load testing containers simulate virtual users that perform requests against the API being tested, how test results are aggregated from multiple containers, how aggregated results are stored in a time series database, and how the results are visualized in a Grafana dashboard.

## Load Generation with Artemis
The team explains how Artemis allows users to start a load test by providing the test script's path and the number of load testing containers to be spun up. The load testing containers use a custom image that includes k6 and a Node application to execute the test script and generate load. The load generation is scaled by spinning up multiple containers, and the chosen number of virtual users per container is determined based on resource availability.

## Data Aggregation with Artemis
Artemis uses the Telegraf tool to aggregate test results from multiple containers into a central location. Telegraf acts as a server-based agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from specified input sources. It receives the data generated by each load testing container and aggregates it based on specified metrics. The aggregated data is then stored in a time series database for long-term storage and further analysis.

## Data Storage with Artemis
Artemis uses Amazon Timestream as the time series database for storing the aggregated test results. Timestream is a serverless database designed to handle time series data with high scalability. The aggregated results are stored in Timestream for historical monitoring purposes.

## Result Visualization with Artemis
Artemis provides a Grafana dashboard for visualizing the test results in near real-time. Users can spin up a Grafana container using the Artemis CLI, which automatically queries the Timestream database and displays the results. The default dashboard view includes metrics such as virtual users simulated, request duration, requests per second, and request failures. Custom queries can be added to the dashboard to display additional metrics based on user preferences.

## Future Work for Artemis
The team briefly touches on ideas for future work, including scaling the aggregation step to accommodate a greater number of virtual users, implementing an automatically generated executive summary of test results, and adding functionality to schedule tests.

## ELI5 Summary
Artemis is like a toolbox for testing APIs. You can use it to make sure your API is working well before you let real users use it. It helps you to generate a lot of traffic to your API, collect all the results, and show them to you in a nice dashboard. It can also store the results for a long time so that you can look at them later. Artemis is flexible and can be used by small and medium-sized companies who can't build their own testing tools or afford expensive cloud solutions.
