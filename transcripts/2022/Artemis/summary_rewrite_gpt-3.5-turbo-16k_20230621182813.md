# Artemis - Capstone Project Video Analysis

## Introduction

The capstone project discussed in the video is called "Artemis," which is an open-source serverless framework designed for scalable, load testing of APIs. The video begins with the team introducing themselves and explaining that they developed Artemis as a fully remote team spanning four different cities and three different time zones. The team members are located in Seattle, Washington; Fairfax, Virginia; St. John's, Newfoundland; and Portland, Oregon.

## ELI5 Summary

Artemis is a tool that helps developers test the performance of their APIs. It simulates multiple users interacting with the API to see how it handles the load. This is important because APIs account for a significant portion of network traffic, and if they can't handle the load, it can result in downtime and financial losses for companies. Existing load testing tools have limitations, such as the amount of load that can be generated locally and the restrictions of cloud-based tools. Artemis aims to address these limitations by providing a scalable, open-source solution for API load testing. It allows developers to easily deploy the necessary infrastructure on their AWS account and run comprehensive load tests without restrictions on the number of virtual users or test duration. The aggregated test results are visualized in near real-time using a provided dashboard, and the results are stored for long-term analysis. With Artemis, developers can efficiently and confidently test the performance of their APIs and ensure high availability.

## Specific Tools Used

### Cloud Services
- AWS (Amazon Web Services):
  - AWS Cloud Development Kit
  - AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
  - AWS Timestream

### Languages
- JavaScript

### Other Technologies
- K6 (open-source load testing tool)
- Grafana (data visualization tool)
- Telegraph (server-based agent for collecting and sending metrics)
- S3 (AWS Simple Storage Service)
- AWS Lambdas (functions as a service)
- AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Cloud Map (service for exposing containers using a private API)

## Detailed Explanation

### Load Testing and API Performance

The video begins by defining load testing as simulating the usage of an application, website, or collection of resources to test their behavior under certain conditions. Load testing helps identify and fix errors, bugs, and bottlenecks before deployment, as well as validate assumptions about the performance of existing infrastructure. API load testing specifically focuses on simulating raw network requests without considering the graphical user interface. This helps measure the performance of the system and identify any bottlenecks.

### Challenges with Existing Load Testing Tools

The team discusses common challenges with existing load testing tools, particularly K6. One limitation is the amount of load that can be generated locally, which is limited by the machine's memory and CPU. Cloud-based load testing tools, like K6 Cloud, address this limitation but come with subscription-based plans that impose limitations such as test duration and the number of virtual users. This can be restrictive and costly, especially for small and medium-sized companies.

### Introducing Artemis

Artemis is presented as a solution for scalable, open-source API load testing. It allows developers to easily deploy the necessary infrastructure on their AWS account using a single CLI command. Artemis leverages K6, an open-source load testing tool, allowing developers to write load tests in JavaScript. Artemis eliminates restrictions on the number of virtual users and test duration, enabling comprehensive load tests. The aggregated test results are visualized in near real-time using a provided Grafana dashboard, and the results are stored for long-term analysis.

### Artemis Architecture

The architecture of Artemis consists of four main components: load generation, aggregation, data storage, and result visualization.

1. Load Generation: The load generation component utilizes load testing containers to simulate virtual users that perform requests against the API being tested. The load generation is scaled by running multiple load testing containers in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on AWS. Each load testing instance pulls a custom image from AWS's Elastic Container Registry (ECR), which includes K6 and a Node.js application called Artemis.js.

2. Aggregation: The aggregation component collects and processes the test results generated by the load testing containers. This is done to provide meaningful insights into the performance of the API. The data is aggregated to reflect the overall load testing results instead of individual container results, reducing noise and improving performance.

3. Data Storage: The aggregated test results are stored in a time series database for long-term analysis. Artemis uses AWS Timestream as the time series database solution, which is serverless and integrates well with the overall architecture.

4. Result Visualization: The result visualization component provides a dashboard, powered by Grafana, to visualize the test results in near real-time. The dashboard displays metrics such as virtual user simulation, request duration, requests per second, and request errors. The Grafana dashboard is connected to the Timestream database, allowing users to customize the dashboard and view the results.

### Future Work

The team mentions ideas for future work, including scaling the aggregation step to handle a greater number of virtual users, implementing an automatically generated executive summary of the test results, and adding functionality to schedule tests alongside on-demand testing.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, Artemis offers a solution for scalable, open-source API load testing. It addresses the limitations of local testing and the restrictions of traditional cloud-based solutions. With Artemis, developers can efficiently and confidently test the performance of their APIs and ensure high availability. The team concludes the presentation by opening the floor for questions.
