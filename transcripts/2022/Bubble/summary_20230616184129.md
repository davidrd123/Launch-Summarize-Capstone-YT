# Coding Capstone Project Video Analysis

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed analysis of a coding Capstone project video. The video transcript revolves around a project called "Bubble," which is an automated open-source solution for deploying dynamic front-end preview apps. The team members introduce themselves and outline the agenda for the presentation.

## Overview of Web Development History
The presenters begin by giving a brief overview of the history of web development to provide context for the types of apps that Bubble supports. They discuss the traditional approach of server-side rendering (SSR) and the rise in popularity of static site generation (SSG).

## The Problem Bubble Solves
The presenters explain the problem Bubble aims to solve by discussing scenarios where servers need to dynamically generate pages and where static pages are sufficient. They highlight the inefficiencies and limitations of using either SSR or SSG alone.

## Introduction to Preview Apps
The next section introduces the concept of preview apps, which are lightweight and fully functional versions of an application that can be easily built and deployed. Preview apps allow non-technical stakeholders to review UI/UX changes quickly and provide feedback, reducing the development feedback loop.

## Existing Solutions for Preview Apps
The presenters explore existing solutions for preview apps, including DIY approaches and preview apps as a feature or service. They compare features, benefits, and drawbacks of each approach, including considerations related to hosting platforms and infrastructure requirements.

## Bubble Features and Demo
The presenters introduce Bubble's features, including automated deployment of preview apps, unique URLs for each app, a visual dashboard for managing apps, and a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with apps. They provide a brief demo on how to use Bubble and showcase its capabilities.

## Building Bubble
The team explains how they built Bubble, including the design decisions and trade-offs they made. They discuss the use of GitHub actions to automate the build and deployment process, the integration with AWS services for infrastructure provisioning, and the implementation of the CLI and visual dashboard.

## Challenges Encountered
The presenters discuss challenges they encountered during implementation, specifically related to deleting preview apps and capturing build logs. They explain how they addressed these challenges by implementing solutions such as using additional commands and leveraging GitHub workflows.

## Future Expansion and Improvement
The team shares their plans for the future of Bubble, including adding support for other front-end frameworks, distributing the dashboard to multiple developers, and exploring integration with alternative cloud providers. They highlight their commitment to continuously improve Bubble based on user feedback and needs.

## ELI5 Summary
Bubble is a tool that helps developers and non-technical stakeholders collaborate on UI/UX changes for web applications. It provides a way to quickly deploy and share fully functional preview versions of an app so that everyone can see and give feedback on the changes. Bubble automates the process of creating these preview apps and makes it easy for developers to manage them using a visual dashboard or a command-line interface.

## Tools Used
- Cloud Services: AWS (Lambda, CloudFront, S3, DynamoDB), GitHub Actions
- Languages: JavaScript
- Other Technologies: Next.js, Serverless Framework, GitHub, npm

In conclusion, Bubble is a valuable tool for streamlining the development process and facilitating collaboration between developers and stakeholders. It leverages the power of AWS and GitHub to automate the deployment of preview apps, making it easier to gather feedback and iterate on UI/UX changes. The project demonstrates the team's solid understanding of web development architecture and their ability to build a practical solution to address a specific problem in the industry.
