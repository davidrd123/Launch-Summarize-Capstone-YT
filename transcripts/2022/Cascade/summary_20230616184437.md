# Analysis of Cascade Capstone Project Video

## Introduction
The video is a presentation of a coding Capstone project called Cascade, which is an open-source containerized application deployment solution. The project was developed by a remote team spread over three different time zones. The video is presented by four team members: Rona, Ewan, Natalie, and Ann. The presentation provides an overview of the problem space, current solutions, a demo of Cascade, and discussions about its architecture, challenges encountered during development, and future enhancements.

## Problem Space
The presentation begins with Rona discussing the challenges of deploying software applications. Software applications require specific environments to run, such as development, staging, and production environments. Manually configuring each environment for each application is time-consuming and error-prone. Different platforms and dependencies can cause compatibility issues, resulting in longer deployment cycles. Using a quote from the creator of Docker, Rona emphasizes the need for reliability in deploying software across various platforms and the importance of packaging application code with its dependencies.

## Containers and Container Orchestration
Ewan takes over and explains the solution to the challenges mentioned earlier, which is the use of containers. Containers are standardized software packages that contain all the necessary elements to run an application, regardless of the underlying environment. Containers can deploy on multiple operating systems consistently and can scale horizontally. Ewan also introduces the concept of container orchestration, which automates the tasks required in the container life cycle, such as provisioning, networking configuration, scheduling, and resource allocation. He mentions two popular container orchestration solutions: Kubernetes and Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS).

## Observability and OpenTelemetry
Natalie continues the presentation by discussing the importance of observability in the deployment of containerized applications. Observability refers to the collection and analysis of telemetry data, such as logs, metrics, and traces, to understand and troubleshoot application behavior. She introduces the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's OpenTelemetry (OTel) project, which aims to standardize the collection and transmission of telemetry data. The OTel project consists of receivers, processors, and exporters that process the data and send it to various backends for visualization and analysis.

## Cascade's Architecture and Features
Ann takes over and provides an overview of Cascade's architecture and functionality. Cascade is an open-source containerized application deployment solution that automates the deployment and management of containerized applications with built-in observability. Cascade's architecture includes a graphical user interface (GUI), a cascade agent for instrumenting applications, and a backend for creating infrastructure and managing resources.

## Demo of Cascade
The team provides a live demo of Cascade, showing the three-step setup process for deploying containerized applications. The GUI allows users to input application details, create an application, and configure the necessary credentials. Once the deployment is initiated, Cascade generates terraform configuration files and deploys the application onto AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate, using an application load balancer for high-availability. The dashboard of the GUI provides real-time updates on the deployment progress and allows users to view logs and traces.

## Challenges and Future Enhancements
The team discusses the challenges they encountered during the development of Cascade. They mention the lack of automated solutions for distributed traces as the initial inspiration for Cascade and the need to simplify the process of instrumenting applications. They also highlight the challenge of real-time data communication between the backend and frontend, which they solved using server-sent events.

In terms of future enhancements, the team plans to add support for users' existing VPC and subnets, allow users to upload custom terraform config files, and provide an interactive infrastructure map on the Cascade dashboard to visualize resource relationships.

## ELI5 Summary
Cascade is like a deployment and management tool for containerized applications. It automates the process of deploying applications in a consistent and reliable way, regardless of the underlying environment, using standardized containers. Cascade also makes it easier for developers to understand and troubleshoot their applications by collecting and analyzing telemetry data. It has a user-friendly interface where users can input their application details, deploy the application with just a few clicks, and view logs and traces. Cascade simplifies the complex process of deploying applications onto the cloud and provides built-in observability features.

## Tools Used
