# Capstone Project: Cascade - Containerized Application Deployment Solution

This markdown document provides a detailed analysis of the coding Capstone project video presenting Cascade, an open-source containerized application deployment solution. 

## Introduction

Cascade is an application developed by a fully remote team across three different time zones. It aims to simplify the deployment process of containerized applications and provide built-in observability. 

The video starts by introducing the team members and their roles in the project. It then discusses the challenges related to deploying software applications, such as the reliance on specific environments and the time-consuming and error-prone manual setup of each environment. To address these challenges, the concept of containerization is introduced. Containers are standardized software packages that contain all the necessary elements to run an application, ensuring consistent behavior across platforms.

## Benefits of Containers

Containers provide several benefits, including the ability to deploy applications across multiple operating systems consistently, scale horizontally, and faster deployment processes. However, the challenges of managing and orchestrating containers remain. Container orchestration automates various tasks in the container lifecycle, such as provisioning, networking configuration, scheduling, and resource allocation. 

Popular container orchestration solutions include Kubernetes and Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). These services help manage the complexity of running containers on the cloud and allow developers to deploy, scale, and secure containers with minimal effort.

## Observability

While container orchestration services attempt to mitigate failures automatically, developers still need insight into the system to identify and fix issues. Observability is introduced as the idea of collecting and analyzing telemetry data, including logs, metrics, and traces, to pinpoint where problems originate. Observability tools, such as the OpenTelemetry project, aim to standardize the collection and transmission of telemetry data for analysis.

## Infrastructure for Containerized Applications on AWS

The video then dives into the infrastructure required to deploy containerized applications on the cloud, using AWS as an example. AWS provides a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for securely running applications. High availability is achieved by implementing redundancy across multiple availability zones within the VPC. 

The VPC contains subnets that provide IP addresses for outbound traffic to the internet. Deploying containerized applications on AWS ECS Fargate is explained, where applications are hosted on ECS with Fargate, and an application load balancer is placed between the application instances and the public internet.

## Existing Solutions

Various approaches to deploying containerized applications are discussed. The AWS Management Console provides comprehensive tools for deploying applications into a cloud network, but it can be tedious and time-consuming. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools, such as Terraform, automate infrastructure setup by writing scripts. AWS Copilot simplifies deployment using AWS CloudFormation but lacks automation in observability.

## Cascade: Containerized Application Deployment Solution

Cascade is introduced as an open-source containerized application deployment solution that aims to automate the deployment process and provide built-in observability. It offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy deployment, log, and trace viewing. Cascade uses Terraform as its infrastructure-as-code tool, providing flexibility and support for new features.

To deploy with Cascade, users need to install the Cascade agent, configure AWS CLI credentials, containerize and instrument their application code, and use the Cascade GUI to set up the deployment. Cascade generates Terraform config files for each container, including a collector container for telemetry data, and deploys them automatically.

## Cascade Architecture

The architecture of Cascade consists of three main components: the GUI, the Cascade agent for instrumentation, and the backend. The GUI provides an intuitive interface for managing deployments, the agent enables distributed tracing, and the backend handles the generation of Terraform config files and the deployment process.

## Deployment Process with Cascade

The video explains the step-by-step process of deploying applications with Cascade using the GUI. Users need to provide information about the containerized applications they want to deploy, including names, image links, ports, and environment variables. Cascade generates Terraform JSON config files for each container, along with a collector container for telemetry data.

Once the config files are generated, users can trigger the deployment process by clicking "Deploy Stack" in the GUI. The backend server sends messages to the frontend to indicate the progress of each resource creation. Users can view logs and traces from the interface and visit the deployed application. 

Cascade also supports the destruction of resources with a click of a button, ensuring easy teardown of the application.

## Design Decisions and Future Improvements

The video discusses the design decisions behind Cascade, such as the use of AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) for observability, the real-time communication between frontend and backend using server-sent events, and the automation of ECS setup using Terraform CDK. 

Future improvements for Cascade include adding support for users' existing VPC and subnets, allowing the upload of custom Terraform config files, and providing an interactive infrastructure map on the Cascade dashboard.

## ELI5 Summary

Cascade is like a magic tool that makes it super easy for developers to deploy their applications in different environments without worrying about compatibility or complex setup. It uses containers, which are like little packages that contain everything the application needs to run. Cascade also helps manage multiple containers by automating tasks like provisioning and networking. It even collects data to help developers identify and fix problems. It has a user-friendly interface and uses tools like Terraform and AWS services to simplify the deployment process.
