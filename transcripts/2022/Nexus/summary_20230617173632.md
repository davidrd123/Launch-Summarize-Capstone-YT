# Nexus: A Coding Capstone Project

## Introduction
In this coding Capstone project video, the team presents Nexus, an open-source GraphQL framework. They discuss the problems with REST APIs, the benefits of GraphQL, the challenges developers face when implementing a GraphQL API, existing solutions in the GraphQL ecosystem, and how Nexus fits in. The team demonstrates the process of setting up and deploying a GraphQL server using Nexus.

## Specific Tools Used
- Nexue (open-source GraphQL framework)
- GraphQL Mesh (powerful GraphQL API generator)
- GraphQL SDL (GraphQL Schema Definition Language)
- PG Promise (PostgreSQL library for validating database connection string)
- Docker (containerization platform)
- AWS (Amazon Web Services - cloud computing platform)
- AWS CLI (AWS Command Line Interface)
- Terraform (infrastructure as code tool)
- Elastic Container Registry (AWS service for container image storage)
- AWS Elastic Container Service and Fargate (container management services)

## ELI5 Summary
The team built Nexus, which helps developers quickly build, deploy, and manage GraphQL APIs. 

Imagine you are building a house, and you have different suppliers for bricks, cement, and wood. But instead of going to each supplier separately, Nexus acts as a middleman and brings everything together for you. It takes data from multiple sources, organizes it into a GraphQL API, and deploys it to the cloud. This means that all the clients (like mobile apps or websites) can request data from a single endpoint, saving time and ensuring that they only receive the data they need.

Nexus simplifies the process of building a GraphQL server by providing tools that generate the server code and schema from the user's existing data sources. It also takes care of the deployment process, making it easy to deploy the server to the user's AWS account. Nexus offers some benefits of managed services (like easy setup) while still allowing for extension and customization.

In summary, Nexus helps developers efficiently build and deploy GraphQL APIs by simplifying the setup process and providing tools for code generation and deployment.

## Detailed Explanation
The video can be divided into the following sections:

### 1. Introduction to Nexus (00:00 - 02:20)
The team introduces Nexus as an open-source GraphQL framework. They explain that Nexus takes a user's existing data sources, generates a GraphQL API, and deploys it to the cloud. The goal is to help developers build and deploy GraphQL servers quickly.

### 2. Understanding REST APIs and Problems with Overfetching and Underfetching (02:20 - 07:20)
The team explains REST APIs and their popularity due to their simplicity. However, they highlight the problems of overfetching and underfetching in REST APIs. Overfetching occurs when a client receives more data than it needs, leading to slower performance. Underfetching occurs when an endpoint does not contain all the required data, leading to multiple round trips between the client and server and increased page load times.

### 3. Introduction to GraphQL and Its Benefits(07:20 - 10:50)
The team introduces GraphQL as an alternative to REST APIs, explaining that it allows clients to request the exact data they need in a single query. They outline situations where GraphQL is beneficial, such as supporting multiple front-end clients with different data access patterns, handling nested and interrelated data, or when the data is distributed across many sources.

### 4. Challenges of Implementing a GraphQL API and Existing Solutions (10:50 - 15:00)
The team discusses the challenges developers face when implementing a GraphQL API, such as learning the GraphQL specification, deciding on a schema writing approach, and deploying the server to the cloud. They explore existing solutions in the GraphQL ecosystem, such as managed services (Hasura, StepZen) and open-source GraphQL API generator libraries (WonderGraph, GraphQL Mesh). They explain the trade-offs between managed services and open-source solutions, with managed services providing ease of setup but limited extendability, while open-source solutions offer more control but require more development effort.

### 5. Introduction to Nexus and its Features (15:00 - 20:15)
The team presents Nexus as a framework that addresses the challenges faced by small teams in building and deploying GraphQL APIs. Nexus simplifies the setup process by generating a GraphQL API server using GraphQL Mesh and provides options for connecting multiple data sources. They demonstrate the features of Nexus, such as adding data sources (e.g., PostgreSQL, REST endpoints), testing the server locally, deploying the server to the user's AWS account, and managing the server using a local dashboard.

### 6. Nexus Architecture and Development Challenges (20:15 - 27:15)
The team explains the architecture of Nexus, which utilizes GraphQL Mesh for schema generation and containerization using Docker for deployment. They discuss the challenges faced during the development process, such as handling data associations across different sources and implementing hot reloading for testing changes in the local development server. They also explain the deployment workflow using private image repositories and AWS services like Elastic Container Service and Fargate.

### 7. Conclusion and Q&A (27:15 - end)
The team concludes the presentation by summarizing the benefits of Nexus in saving developer time, simplifying the setup process, and providing extendability. They open the floor for a Q&A session.

In conclusion, Nexus is an open-source GraphQL framework that simplifies the process of building and deploying GraphQL APIs. It provides tools for code generation, handles data associations across different sources, and streamlines the deployment process to the user's AWS account. Nexus aims to save developers time and provide flexibility in extending and customizing their GraphQL APIs.
