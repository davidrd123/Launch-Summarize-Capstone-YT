# Scopos - API Monitoring Tool

## Introduction
Scopos is a free and open-source API monitoring tool developed by a team of four individuals. The team consists of Hans, Ellie, Catherine, Gagan, and Michaela. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring API workflows and running tests in parallel. In this video transcript, they discuss the purpose of API monitoring, different approaches to API monitoring, existing API monitoring solutions, the features of Scopos, and the implementation details of Scopos.

## ELI5 Summary
Scopos is a tool that helps companies ensure their APIs are working properly. APIs are like the plumbing that connects different parts of software together. If an API fails, it can cause problems for the entire system. Scopos helps companies monitor their APIs by checking that they are working correctly, responding in a timely manner, and returning the expected results. It allows users to define tests, run them on a schedule, and get notified if something goes wrong. The team built Scopos using various tools and technologies, including AWS cloud services, GraphQL, Prisma, and XState.

## Tools Used
The team utilized the following tools and technologies in the development of Scopos:
- AWS (Amazon Web Services): Cloud services for hosting various components of Scopos.
- S3: Storage service for hosting the front-end build of Scopos.
- Elastic Load Balancer: Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Virtual machines for hosting Docker containers.
- RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed database service for storing data related to Scopos.
- GraphQL: Query language for APIs used to retrieve precise data for tests.
- Apollo Client: A GraphQL client library used in the front-end for communication with the back-end.
- Apollo Server: A GraphQL server used in the back-end to handle client requests.
- Postgres: Relational database management system used in conjunction with Prisma.
- Prisma: Object-relational mapping (ORM) tool for working with databases in a more convenient way.
- EventBridge: Serverless event bus used for scheduling tests.
- Lambda: Serverless function used as an intermediary between EventBridge and the Collection Runner.
- Simple Notification Service (SNS): Service used for sending notifications to various channels, such as PagerDuty, email, and Slack.
- XState: State management library used in the Collection Runner to handle the complex logic of executing tests.
- Docker: Platform used for containerization and running multiple instances of the Collection Runner.

## Detailed Explanation
The video transcript is divided into several sections, each covering different aspects of Scopos. I will provide a breakdown of each section, explaining its content and relevance.

### Introduction to API Monitoring
In this section, the team explains what APIs are and emphasizes their importance in modern software applications. They describe how APIs act as the connective tissue that binds different application services together. The team then highlights the consequences of API failures and explains how API monitoring tools are crucial in detecting these failures. They identify three main aspects of API failures: unexpected data payload in the response, unacceptable response time, and incorrect HTTP status code.

### Different Approaches to API Monitoring
The team explores four different approaches to API monitoring: multi-step tests, parallel tests, geolocation-based tests, and CI/CD integrated tests. They provide an overview of each approach's functionality and highlight the use cases where each approach is applicable. The team emphasizes that the choice of approach depends on the specific requirements of the use case.

### Existing API Monitoring Solutions
The team discusses three existing API monitoring tools: Newman, Checkley, and Testful. They explain the key features and drawbacks of each tool, highlighting the limitations that led them to develop their own tool, Scopos. They mention that their primary motivation for building Scopos was the need for an open-source solution that allows monitoring multi-step API workflows, executing tests in parallel, and providing a user-friendly GUI.

### Scopos Overview and Demonstration
The team introduces Scopos, emphasizing its core functionality of defining tests, executing tests, scheduling tests, and notifying users of test failures. They provide an overview of the user interface and demonstrate how to define multi-step tests using the GUI. They also showcase the scheduling functionality and explain how users can receive notifications through different channels, such as email, Slack, and PagerDuty.

### Building Scopos: Core Components
In this section, the team dives into the implementation details of the core components of Scopos. They discuss how they tackled the challenge of referencing values from previous tests in multi-step workflows. They explain the use of collections to group tests together and the introduction of a reference flag for interpolation of previous values.

The team also discusses how they handled data storage and retrieval challenges by utilizing GraphQL and Prisma. They explain how they implemented a policy server, Apollo client, and Apollo server to interact with the database, ensuring precise data retrieval and schema migration.

### Building Scopos: Execution and Scheduling
The team focuses on the execution and scheduling functionalities of Scopos in this section. They explain the complexity of making API calls and handling the logic of executing tests. They introduce the concept of a state machine and its role in running collections of tests. They provide a detailed breakdown of the different states and transitions in the state machine, illustrating how data is processed, requests are sent, responses are checked, and assertions are evaluated.

The team also discusses the implementation of scheduling using AWS EventBridge. They explain how cron expressions are used to trigger events on a schedule and how a Lambda function serves as an intermediary between EventBridge and the Collection Runner. They highlight the benefits of decoupling scheduling functionality from other processes and preventing data loss in case of failures.

### Building Scopos: Cloud Infrastructure
In this section, the team explores the cloud infrastructure used for Scopos. They present an architecture diagram showing the different components, such as S3, EC2, ECS, RDS, and the Collection Runner. They discuss the decision to use a multi-tenant approach for parallel testing and explain the use of Docker containers and load balancers to achieve parallel execution of tests. They also explain the usage of AWS Fargate and Elastic Container Service (ECS) with EC2 as alternatives for running containers.

The team then delves into the implementation of scheduling using AWS EventBridge and the integration of SNS for notifications. They explain how topics and subscribers are created, how messages are published, and how notifications are sent to various channels.

### Future Work
The team concludes the presentation by discussing future work for Scopos. They mention three main areas of improvement: implementing a sandbox environment for troubleshooting, generating random data for testing edge cases, and implementing smart notifications to prevent repeated notifications for the same issue. They express their enthusiasm for the project and learning experience and invite questions and discussions from the audience.

## Conclusion
The team behind Scopos has successfully developed an open-source API monitoring tool that addresses the need for monitoring multi-step API workflows, executing tests in parallel, and providing a user-friendly GUI. They utilized various tools and technologies, such as AWS cloud services, GraphQL, Prisma, and XState, to build the core components of Scopos. Through their presentation, they showcased the functionality of Scopos, explained their implementation choices, and discussed potential future improvements.
