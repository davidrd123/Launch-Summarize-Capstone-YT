# Coding Capstone Project - Query

## Description

This is a transcript of a video presentation about a coding Capstone project called "Query." The project team, consisting of Chris, Anna, Arjun, and Tony, introduces their open source dead letter queue (DLQ) as a service for distributed applications. 

The video covers various aspects of the Query project, including its use case, existing solutions, installation and usage guide, challenges faced during the building process, and future directions. The team explains the importance of DLQs, the limitations of existing solutions, and the features provided by Query.

## ELI5 Summary

The Query project is about building a tool called Query that helps developers manage dead letter queues (DLQs) in their distributed applications. A DLQ is like a backup queue for messages that failed to be processed correctly. Query provides an open source, fully customizable, and user-friendly solution for monitoring, managing, and interacting with DLQ messages. 

With Query, developers can easily identify and troubleshoot message processing issues, modify and resend failed messages, and perform various operations for efficient DLQ management. The team behind Query aims to simplify the complex process of working with DLQs and enhance developers' ability to ensure reliable message processing in distributed applications.

## Tools Used

Specific tools used in the project include:

- AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS): A fully managed messaging queue service for the decoupling and scaling of microservices and distributed systems.
- AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS): A fully managed messaging service for communication and notifications between applications.
- AWS DynamoDB: A fully managed NoSQL database for storing and querying JSON-formatted data.
- AWS Lambda: A serverless compute service for running code in response to triggers, providing scalable and event-driven functionality.
- Slack: A messaging platform for team communication and collaboration.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used for building scalable network applications.
- Express: A popular Node.js framework for building web applications and APIs.
- Serverless360: A leading platform for monitoring dead letter messages in testing, development, and production environments.
- Service Bus Explorer: An open-source solution for managing dead letter messages in Azure Service Bus.
- npm: A package manager for JavaScript and Node.js.
- AWS SDK: A software development kit for interacting with AWS services and building applications.
- AWS CloudWatch: A monitoring and observability service for AWS resources and applications.
- CLI: Command-line interface tools for managing and interacting with AWS resources.

It's important to note that the team also developed their own tool, called Query, as an npm package for managing DLQs in AWS infrastructure.

## Explanation

The video transcript can be divided into the following sections:

1. Introduction: The team introduces themselves and explains their work on Query, an open source DLQ as a service for distributed applications. They outline the topics covered in the video, including the use case, existing solutions, installation and usage guide, challenges faced, and future directions.

2. Use Case: The team presents a fictional company, BuyMe, that implements a microservice architecture using AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) for communication between services. They explain the benefits and challenges of microservice architectures and asynchronous communication.

3. Existing Solutions: The team compares BuyMe's use of AWS SQS as a DLQ solution and the challenges they encountered with message processing failures and poison messages. They describe the limitations of AWS DLQ management and explore other DLQ monitoring tools, such as Serverless360 and Service Bus Explorer.

4. Introduction to Query: The team introduces Query as an open source DLQ as a service specifically designed for small distributed applications using AWS infrastructure. They highlight the benefits and features of Query, explaining how it improves upon existing solutions.

5. Installation and Usage: The team presents a step-by-step guide for installing and using Query. They explain the three installation steps, deployment options, and the Query dashboard's features, such as message viewing, sorting, modifying, deleting, and re-driving.

6. Building Process Challenges: The team discusses the challenges they faced during the implementation of Query, including the choice between AWS SDK and AWS CDK, monitoring DLQ in real-time, and data type conversion issues in SNS topics.

7. Future Directions: The team highlights possible future enhancements for Query, such as conser log access, slack notifications with action capabilities, and a teardown command for infrastructure destruction.

8. Conclusion: The team concludes the presentation by thanking the audience and inviting questions.

Overall, the video provides a comprehensive overview of Query, its functionalities, and its potential impact on managing DLQs in distributed applications.
