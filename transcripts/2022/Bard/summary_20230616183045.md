# Analyzing Coding Capstone Project Video Transcript

## Introduction
The video transcript is a presentation of a coding Capstone project called "BART: An Open Source Session Replay Tool for Viewing and Analyzing User Sessions." The project aims to address the problem of understanding user behavior and improving conversion rates on web applications. The presentation is divided into six sections, including an introduction to the team, exploration of the problem domain, description of BART's architecture, major design decisions, challenges during development, and different deployment options.

## Team Introduction
The team behind BART consists of four members who worked remotely across different time zones. The team members are: 
- Morrison, based in Vancouver
- Nino, based in Boston
- Jean, based in Tulsa
- Aaron (presenter), based in Austin

## Problem Domain Exploration
The team explores the problem domain BART aims to address. They introduce the concept of user sessions, which are sustained interactions of users with web applications. They highlight the challenge for developers in understanding user behavior and identifying issues that prevent conversions.

To address this problem, BART focuses on providing both quantitative and qualitative data to gain insight into user behavior. The team discusses options like heat maps and metrics but emphasizes the limitations of these approaches in providing context and individual session analysis. BART's solution involves session replay, which allows developers to watch exactly how users interacted with their application, gaining insights into user experience and identifying conversion issues.

## BART: An Open Source Session Replay Tool
The team provides a demonstration of BART's use and functionality. BART is an open-source tool that enables the review and analysis of user sessions. It allows developers to filter and view recorded sessions, analyze conversion funnels, and play back user experiences as if they were videos.

The user interface of BART lists available session recordings, which can be filtered by date, duration, application name, and errors. Developers can select a session to view and replay the user's experience. The progress bar highlights custom events and application errors logged during the session replay. The reconstructed DOM is updated based on recorded mutations and events, providing an accurate representation of the user's experience.

Additionally, BART offers conversion analysis using predefined funnels. A funnel consists of a sequence of events that define the desired conversion path. BART evaluates user sessions to determine which steps in the funnel were completed and where users dropped off. By analyzing conversion funnels, developers can identify and resolve issues that prevent users from completing desired actions.

## BART's Architecture
The team provides a detailed description of BART's architecture, which comprises eight components divided into three groups: collection, data processing and storage, and analysis and replay.

The collection group consists of the agent, an npm package named "BARD RR" responsible for collecting session data from web applications. The agent records DOM mutations, user events, and custom event tracking using the RR Web session recording engine.

The data processing and storage group encompasses multiple components, including the Agent API, RabbitMQ message queue, Clickhouse database, and Postgres database. The Agent API receives and processes data from the agent, authenticates data, identifies conversion events, and stores active session metadata in Postgres. Data points for session replay and conversion analysis are sent to RabbitMQ for high-throughput event data. Clickhouse stores event data and conversion event metadata for finalized sessions.

The analyze and replay group consists of the Replayer API and Replayer User Interface. The Replayer API connects the user interface to Clickhouse and Postgres databases, handles session listing, and performs CRUD operations for conversion funnels. The Replayer User Interface, built with React and Material UI, allows users to easily filter sessions, define and view conversion funnels.

## Major Design Decisions
The team discusses the major design decisions made during the development of BART. They highlight the choice of coln-oriented databases, Cassandra and Clickhouse, for handling high write throughputs. They explain the integration of RabbitMQ with Clickhouse to handle high volumes of event data. PostgreSQL is used for handling mutable session and funnel data, while Clickhouse stores immutable event data.

The team also mentions the challenge of persisting session IDs through page reloads and navigation. They describe the use of the session storage browser API to generate session IDs and detect session start and end.

## Challenges During Development
The team outlines the challenges they encountered during the development process. One major challenge was organizing the data generated by RR Web into sessions. They solved this challenge by generating a unique session ID and tagging each data point with this ID. They used session storage and server-side components to track session start and end.

Another challenge was implementing conversion analysis using custom funnels. The team had to dynamically create and execute SQL queries based on the session filters and event sequence defined by the user.

## Deployment Options
The team discusses different deployment options for BART. They provide instructions for cloning the deploy repository and running BART locally using Docker Compose. They also mention the option of deploying BART on Amazon Web Services using Elastic Container Service, EC2 instances, and Elastic File System.

## ELI5 Summary
BART is an open-source tool that helps developers understand how users interact with web applications and improve conversion rates. It allows developers to replay user sessions, analyze conversion funnels, and gain insights into user behavior. BART's architecture consists of components for data collection, processing and storage, and analysis and replay. The development process involved overcoming challenges in session management and implementing conversion analysis. BART can be deployed locally using Docker Compose or on Amazon Web Services.

## Tools Used
- Language: JavaScript
- Framework: React
- Libraries: Material UI, RR Web
- Databases: RabbitMQ, Clickhouse, and PostgreSQL
- Deployment: Docker Compose, Amazon Web Services (Elastic Container Service, EC2 instances, and Elastic File System)

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the BART project, explaining each section of the presentation and highlighting the specific tools and technologies used.
