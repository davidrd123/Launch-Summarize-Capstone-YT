# Coding Capstone Project Video Analysis

## Introduction
The video is a presentation by a team of developers who created Qmentis, an observability tool for GraphQL APIs. The team introduces the hypothetical company Novels and Barnes, an independent bookstore facing challenges with their mobile web application. They explain the benefits of developing a GraphQL API and the need for observability specific to GraphQL APIs. The team discusses existing GraphQL observability solutions and presents Qmentis as an open-source solution. They provide an overview of Novels and Barnes' use case and explain the importance of observability. The team then discusses the architecture and implementation challenges of Qmentis. The video concludes with a demo installation and future work ideas.

## ELI5 Summary
The team created Qmentis, a tool to help Novels and Barnes monitor and analyze their GraphQL API. Novels and Barnes, an independent bookstore, faced challenges with their mobile web app. They decided to implement a GraphQL API to improve performance and reduce latency. However, they needed to monitor the health of the API and ensure optimal performance. Observability is the ability to measure and analyze a system's current state based on data it generates. For GraphQL APIs, observability is different from REST APIs due to the complexity of GraphQL queries. Existing observability solutions for GraphQL have limitations, so the team created Qmentis, an open-source observability tool specifically designed for GraphQL APIs. Qmentis provides easy tracking of errors, analysis of API performance at the resolver level, and the ability to collect and visualize metrics and traces. Novels and Barnes can use Qmentis to monitor their API for issues, track latency, analyze the API's health, and troubleshoot problems.

## Tools Used
- GraphQL
- Qmentis (open-source observability solution)
- Apollo Studio (fully managed observability and monitoring cloud service for GraphQL)
- Hasura Cloud (fully managed observability and monitoring cloud service for GraphQL)
- ExpressGraphQL (GraphQL server implementation)
- OpenTelemetry (open-source project for generating and collecting telemetry data)
- Prometheus (open-source systems monitoring service for storing metrics)
- TimescaleDB (open-source time series database for storing metrics and traces)
- Grafana (open-source observability tool for visualizing and analyzing metrics and traces)
- Docker (containerization platform)

## Detailed Explanation
1. Introduction:
   - Introduces the team and Qmentis, an observability tool for GraphQL APIs.
   - Explains the challenges faced by the hypothetical company Novels and Barnes with their mobile web application.
   - Discusses the benefits of using a GraphQL API and the need for observability specific to GraphQL APIs.
2. Novels and Barnes' Challenges:
   - Describes Novels and Barnes as an independent bookstore with a small engineering team.
   - Highlights the increase in online sales through their mobile web app and the rise in customer complaints about slow app performance.
3. Benefits of Using a GraphQL API:
   - Explains the limitations of using a REST API for their mobile web app, such as multiple network requests and data overfetching.
   - Describes how a GraphQL API can reduce network requests and fetch only the required data, improving performance and reducing latency.
   - Mentions the implementation challenges and the need for resolvers to fetch data efficiently.
4. Observability for GraphQL APIs:
   - Defines observability as the ability to measure and analyze a system's current state based on generated data.
   - Explains the importance of observability for developers in troubleshooting and debugging applications effectively.
   - Covers the three pillars of observability: metrics, traces, and logs (only metrics and traces discussed in-depth in the presentation).
5. Observability Solutions for GraphQL APIs:
   - Highlights the differences between observability for GraphQL APIs and REST APIs.
   - Discusses existing GraphQL observability solutions like Apollo Studio and Hasura Cloud.
   - Presents Qmentis as an open-source alternative with the ability to track both metrics and traces.
6. Qmentis Architecture:
   - Introduces the architecture of Qmentis, consisting of two main components: Qmentis Express and Qmentis Compose.
   - Explains the four phases of the architecture: generate, export, store, and visualize.
   - Details the functionality of each phase and their interconnectedness.
7. Implementation Challenges and Demo:
   - Describes the challenges faced in collecting meaningful data from a GraphQL server and connecting metrics to traces.
   - Provides a demonstration of Qmentis installation and setup process.
8. Future Work:
   - Discusses future plans for Qmentis, including compatibility with multiple GraphQL server types, expanded metrics features, and incorporating alerts.
9. Conclusion and Q&A:
   - Concludes the presentation with thanks to the audience.
   - Opens the floor for questions from the viewers.
