# Coding Capstone Project Video Analysis

This is an analysis of a coding Capstone project video that discusses the creation of a deployment pipeline tool called Trellis. The video provides a transcript that outlines the project's objectives, technical background, problems encountered, and the architecture of the Trellis system. Additionally, it highlights engineering decisions made during the development process and future improvements planned for Trellis.

## 1. Introduction and Technical Background
The video begins with an introduction to the project and its team members. Trellis is described as an open-source, low-configuration deployment pipeline tool designed for teams developing serverless applications. Its purpose is to streamline the deployment process, minimize steps required for code deployment, and provide a centralized dashboard for monitoring and managing multiple deployment environments.

The technical background section delves into the fundamental concept of deployment and its significance for software development teams. Traditionally, development and operations were handled by separate teams, creating friction and delaying the deployment process. The advent of DevOps, where development and operations are combined into a single team, led to faster application iterations and shorter development cycles. Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes were adopted to automate code integration and ensure its readiness for end-users.

Deployment environments were introduced, such as development, staging, and production environments, each serving specific purposes in the continuous delivery process. Deployment pipelines were instrumental in promoting code through these environments, automating the deployment process, and increasing the efficiency of software releases.

## 2. Architecture of Trellis
The video then proceeds to explain the architecture of Trellis. Trellis is designed as a serverless application hosted on AWS, with the aim of leveraging existing serverless expertise of its target users. The build server is implemented as an AWS ECS Fargate task, providing on-demand computing via containers. Trellis utilizes the Serverless Stack Framework (SST) as its infrastructure-as-code tool and AWS CloudFormation for resource deployment.

The backend of Trellis consists of multiple AWS Lambda functions responsible for various tasks, such as authentication, application creation, environment management, and triggering builds. AWS API Gateway serves as the frontend for the backend, allowing users to interact with Trellis through API endpoints. Trellis utilizes AWS DynamoDB for data storage, storing user logins, application metadata, and deployment environment information.

Trellis Dashboard, the user interface of the system, is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React. The code for the dashboard is stored in an AWS S3 bucket, and AWS CloudFront is used as a content delivery network to serve the dashboard efficiently.

## 3. Engineering Decisions and Trade-offs
The video presents two significant engineering decisions made during the development of Trellis. The first decision is selecting AWS Fargate for the build server, which provides scalability and auto-scaling capabilities. The choice was made based on intermittent builds, pay-as-you-go pricing, and the absence of long-running web servers. The second decision is using AWS CloudWatch and WebSockets for real-time deployment data updates in the dashboard. By subscribing to CloudWatch log events and utilizing WebSocket connections, the Trellis dashboard can receive and display deployment updates as they occur.

## 4. Future Work
The video concludes with a discussion of future improvements planned for Trellis. The team plans to introduce user roles and permissions, optimize deployment times by caching application dependencies, store build artifacts to enable efficient rollbacks, and create a command-line tool to manage deployments locally. They also aim to integrate Trellis with existing CI/CD pipelines and implement vulnerability scanning to prevent deploying applications with known vulnerabilities.

## Summary
Trellis is an open-source, low-configuration deployment pipeline tool designed for teams developing serverless applications on AWS. It simplifies the deployment process, provides a centralized dashboard for monitoring and managing deployment environments, and promotes a DevOps culture by automating deployment operations. The architecture of Trellis is built as a serverless application, leveraging AWS services such as ECS Fargate, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudFront. Engineering decisions were made to optimize scalability, real-time data updates, and user experience. Future improvements include user roles and permissions, deployment time optimizations, integration with CI/CD pipelines, and vulnerability scanning.
