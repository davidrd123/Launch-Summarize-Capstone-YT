# Bastion: A Customizable Backend-as-a-Service Solution

This markdown document provides a detailed analysis of a coding Capstone project video about Bastion, an open-source customizable backend-as-a-service (BaaS) solution. The video transcript gives an overview of Bastion, its components, features, design decisions, architecture, and future work. The document concludes with an ELI5 (Explain Like I'm Five) summary and a list of the specific tools used in the project.

## Introduction
The team presents Bastion as a pre-built backend solution that allows front-end developers to save time on building their own backend and launch their product faster. It is based on cloud hosting services and integrates with AWS Lambda to provide cloud code functionality for custom use cases.

## Components of a Web Application
The team explains that a web application has two main parts: the front end (client-facing code responsible for user interface) and the back end (stores data, handles user authentication, and connects to external services). Fortress IO, a small company, serves as an example of a company that needs a backend for their application but wants to focus on front-end development.

## Different Backend Options
The team explains the different backend options available to Fortress IO:
1. Building a backend from scratch: costly and time-consuming.
2. Using cloud hosting services: infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) or platform-as-a-service (PaaS).
3. Using a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) product: offers pre-built backends but limited customization.

## Limitations of Managed BaaS Providers
The team highlights the limitations of managed BaaS providers, such as limited customizability and the risk of vendor lock-in. They mention the use of cloud code as a solution to address this limitation by allowing users to define custom functions and integrate third-party APIs securely.

## Managed vs Self-Hosted BaaS
The team discusses the two options for BaaS providers: managed and self-hosted. They compare the pros and cons of each, such as ease of deployment, control, configuration, support, and vendor lock-in. They conclude that self-hosted BaaS solutions offer more control and ownership over the backend.

## Introducing Bastion
The team introduces Bastion as an open-source BaaS solution that can be deployed with AWS resources. They highlight its flexibility, extensibility, integration with AWS Lambda, and focus on security and scalability.

## Deployment Process with Bastion
The team explains the deployment process of Bastion, which involves installing the AWS CLI, connecting it with AWS, and then using the Bastion CLI to deploy the admin app to the AWS account. This admin app provides a dashboard for managing and creating backends.

## Admin Application Overview
The team provides an overview of the admin application, consisting of the admin dashboard and the admin app server. The dashboard allows users to create and manage multiple backends, view collections, manage users, handle cloud code functions, and interact with file storage.

## Bastion Backends
The team explains the structure and function of the Bastion backends. Each backend consists of an application server (running on ECS Fargate) and a database server (running on ECS Fargate with MongoDB). The architecture allows for scalability and separation of concerns. Communication between the application and database servers is achieved through AWS CloudMap.

## Bastion Client SDK
The team discusses the Bastion client SDK, which allows front-end developers to interact with Bastion backends. They highlight the available methods for database operations, user authentication, file storage, and cloud code functions.

## Design Decisions and Challenges
The team shares some design decisions they made while building Bastion, such as using Docker containers for flexibility and resource efficiency. They discuss challenges they faced, including user authentication, SSL certificates, container communication, and cloud code function implementation.

## Future Work
The team mentions future work they would like to accomplish, including domain whitelisting, language support expansion, Redis integration for session storage, and deploying Bastion in multiple availability zones for increased availability and resilience.

## Demo of Fortress IO Application
The team provides a demo of an example application built with Bastion. They showcase features such as user authentication, database collection management, file storage, and cloud code function execution.

## ELI5 (Explain Like I'm Five) Summary
Bastion is like a pre-built backend that front-end developers can use for their applications, so they don't have to spend time building their own backend. It integrates with AWS resources and allows customization through cloud code functions. Bastion offers security, scalability, and flexibility, and it can be deployed with the help of an admin application.

## Specific Tools Used
- Cloud Services: AWS CLI, AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), AWS Fargate, AWS CloudFormation, AWS Elastic File System (EFS), AWS Lambda, AWS CloudMap, AWS Route 53.
- Languages: JavaScript (Node.js).
- Other Technologies: Docker, MongoDB, Redis, SSL/TLS Certificates, Stripe API.
