# Coding Capstone Project - Feature Flag Management Platform

## Introduction

The coding Capstone project presented in the video is about a feature flag management platform called Fauna. The team behind Fauna consists of four members: Urim, Rob, Juan, and Audrey. The project aims to provide developers with a platform to test new features in production confidently by using feature flags. The team discusses the problem space, the engineering decisions made, and potential future work.

## Problem Exploration

The team begins by discussing the challenges of testing new features in production and the importance of testing to build confidence in future releases. Developers want to release new features with minimal risk and bugs. Automated testing suites and staging environments help increase confidence, but they cannot eliminate all uncertainties. Production systems and unpredictable user behavior make it difficult to test and guard against all possibilities.

## Fauna as a Solution

Fauna is introduced as an open-source feature flag management platform that allows developers to test new features in production confidently. The team identifies three key strategies to enable responsible testing in production: releasing new code to a small group of users first, isolating the feature causing issues, and rolling back the application to a stable state. After comparing two common approaches, multiple deployments and feature flags, the team concludes that feature flags are a better fit for their use case.

## Feature Flags

The team explains that feature flags consist of conditional statements that determine whether a specific block of code should be executed. They can be used in both front-end and back-end applications. Feature flags offer several benefits, such as selective rollbacks, zero downtime, and the ability to target specific users based on logic or data accessible in the application. However, there are trade-offs, such as technical debt and potential page load times.

## Fauna's Entities

Fauna's entities are introduced, including attributes, audiences, and flags. Attributes represent user traits or characteristics, audiences are collections of conditions that determine if a user is eligible for a specific feature, and flags represent specific features to be tested. The Fauna dashboard allows users to create and manage these entities.

## Fauna's Architecture

The architecture of Fauna is explained, highlighting the responsibilities of each component. The manager platform consists of the UI dashboard and the Manager API backend, which interact with a Postgres database. The Flag Bearer acts as a reverse proxy, managing connections from client applications and evaluating flag data. Redis is used as a data store and message broker, facilitating real-time updates and pub-sub communication. The client and server-side SDKs are embedded into the developer's application and communicate with the Flag Bearer to enable flag evaluation.

## Deployment Options

Fauna can be deployed using Docker Compose or AWS services. With Docker Compose, each component is containerized and connected via a Docker network, allowing for easy deployment and management. In the AWS deployment option, Fauna's architecture is managed with AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), utilizing Elastic Container Service (ECS) for container orchestration, along with other AWS services like RDS, Elasticache, and a load balancer.

## Engineering Decisions and Challenges

The team discusses some of the technical decisions and challenges they faced during the project. They explain how they tailored the SDK implementations for different types of applications and the trade-offs they made. They also discuss the choice of using Postgres as the database, the use of Redis as both a cache and a pub-sub message broker, and the communication patterns used within Fauna's architecture.

## Future Work

The team identifies potential future work for Fauna. This includes reducing latency by hosting Flag Bearer instances on the edge, leveraging SDks to relay metadata back to the Flag Bearer for profiling data, and further optimizing communication between the application and the Flag Bearer.
