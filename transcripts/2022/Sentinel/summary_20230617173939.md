# Capstone Project Transcript Analysis

## Introduction

In this video, the team introduces Sentinel, an open-source platform-as-a-service (PaaS) with canary deployments. They explain the concept of PaaS and how it simplifies the deployment of applications by managing the infrastructure configuration details. Then, they dive into canary deployments, which allow for cautious updates to an application while minimizing downtime and providing the ability to revert back to previous versions if needed. The team discusses the challenges of implementing canary deployments and explains how Sentinel addresses these challenges.

## Specific Tools Used

- Infrastructure: They use Terraform and Ansible to provision and manage compute instances on various cloud providers. This makes Sentinel cloud provider-agnostic.
- Containerization: They utilize Docker and Docker Swarm Mode for containerization and orchestration of applications.
- Reverse Proxy: The team chooses Traffic as their reverse proxy to handle request routing and encryption for HTTPS.
- Monitoring: They integrate Prometheus and Grafana to collect, analyze, and visualize metrics for application performance and health.
- Command Line Interface (CLI): They develop a custom CLI for users to interact with Sentinel and perform tasks such as deploying applications and managing canary deployments.

## Explanation

### Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

The team starts by explaining the concept of PaaS, which manages the infrastructure configuration details for deploying applications. They highlight the benefits of using PaaS for developers, as it allows them to focus on building applications rather than dealing with infrastructure complexities. PaaS abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, providing an easy and efficient way to deploy and manage applications.

### Canary Deployments

The team then explains canary deployments, a cautious approach to deploying updates to an application. Canary deployments involve diverting a portion of user traffic to a new version of the application, allowing developers to monitor its performance before rolling it out to all users. They discuss the advantages of canary deployments, such as fine-grained control over user traffic and the ability to detect and mitigate issues early on.

### Challenges of Canary Deployments

The team highlights the complexity of implementing canary deployments. They mention the need for mechanisms to monitor and track both versions of the application, as well as the requirement for compatibility with existing systems, such as databases. They also emphasize the importance of collecting the right data to make informed decisions about promoting or rolling back canary deployments.

### Sentinel - An Overview

The team introduces Sentinel, an open-source PaaS that simplifies deploying applications with canary deployments. They provide an overview of AppsRS, a web development consultancy that needs a PaaS to manage their applications. They explain how Sentinel automates infrastructure provisioning using Terraform and Ansible, making it cloud provider-agnostic. With Sentinel's CLI, developers can easily deploy applications and enable canary deployments.

### Deploying Applications and Canary Deployments with Sentinel

The team demonstrates how AppsRS uses Sentinel to deploy their applications and enable canary deployments. They show how developers can run commands like `sentinel init` to provision the necessary infrastructure and `sentinel deploy` to deploy an application with a Postgres database. They also showcase the `sentinel canary deploy` command, which initiates canary deployments and allows developers to specify the percentage of traffic to route to the new version.

### Comparison with Existing PaaS Solutions

The team compares Sentinel with other existing PaaS options. They mention closed-source solutions like Heroku and Elastic Beanstalk, which may lack built-in support for canary deployments and come with monthly costs. They also discuss open-source platforms like CapRover, which offer more flexibility and affordability but might sacrifice features and support. Sentinel aims to address these shortcomings by providing an open-source PaaS with canary deployment support.

### Sentinel Architecture and Design Decisions

The team delves into the architecture and design decisions behind Sentinel. They explain how they leverage Docker Swarm Mode for container orchestration and use Traffic as the reverse proxy for request routing and HTTPS encryption. They showcase the integration of Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring application performance and health. They also touch on upcoming features such as support for other cloud providers, build packs, and databases.

### Division of Labor

The team discusses how they divided the labor for the project. They initially split into groups to work on the API/server-side and the CLI/server-side components. Over time, they bridged the gap between these components and collaborated on the design and implementation of the whole project.

### Reflections on the Project

The team reflects on their project and discusses what they might have done differently. They mention spending more time refining the CLI commands to improve user experience. They also consider whether maintaining a database to store the state of applications within Sentinel would have been beneficial for certain functionalities.

## ELI5 Summary

Sentinel is like a toolbox that makes it easy for developers to deploy their applications on the internet and test new versions without breaking everything. It takes care of all the complicated stuff in the background, like managing servers and databases, so developers can focus on building great apps. It also has tools to monitor how well the app is doing and a way to switch back to the old version if the new one isn't working properly.
