# Analysis of Coding Capstone Project Video

## Introduction
The video is a presentation of a coding Capstone project called Seymour, which is an open-source, easy-to-configure active monitoring solution. The project was developed by a team of software engineers and is designed to help engineering teams detect and resolve issues in their production systems before users experience them. Seymour allows users to simulate requests from globally distributed locations to test their API endpoints and measures performance, uptime, and correctness of the payload data.

## Presentation Structure

The presentation is divided into several sections:

1. Overview and introduction to the problem Seymour aims to solve.
2. Explanation of active monitoring and its importance in system health assurance.
3. Overview of existing active monitoring solutions and their pros and cons.
4. Introduction and demo of Seymour, including its features and deployment process.
5. Detailed discussion of Seymour's architecture, including the use of AWS services.
6. Explanation of the design decisions and challenges encountered during the development process.
7. Discussion of additional features and future plans for Seymour.
8. Q&A session.

## ELI5 Summary
Seymour is a coding Capstone project that helps engineering teams monitor their API endpoints. It allows users to simulate requests from different locations to test the performance and correctness of the endpoints. By monitoring these endpoints, teams can detect and resolve issues before users experience them. Seymour is open source, easy to configure, and uses AWS services to handle the monitoring process.

## Tools Used
- **Languages**: The specific programming languages used in the project are not mentioned in the transcript but are likely to include languages such as Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
- **Cloud Services**: The project heavily relies on AWS (Amazon Web Services) for its infrastructure and deployment, including services such as AWS Lambda, AWS EventBridge, AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service), and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- **Other Technologies**: The video mentions the use of the Cloud Development Kit (CDK) and Software Development Kit (SDK) provided by AWS for deploying and managing the project's infrastructure. The project also includes a user interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The specific tools used to build Seymour include AWS Lambda, AWS EventBridge, AWS SNS, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and the CDK/SDK for deployment and infrastructure management. The coding languages used likely include Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
