# Analysis of the Coding Capstone Project Video

## Introduction
The video is a presentation of a coding Capstone project called Waypost, which is an open-source feature flag management platform. The project is specifically designed for A/B testing. The video is presented by Julia, Sean, and Caleb, who have spent the last couple of months developing Waypost. The presentation aims to provide an overview of the problem that Waypost solves, explain A/B testing and feature flags, discuss the solutions for implementing them, and highlight the pros and cons of each solution.

## Problem and Target Organization
The presenters start by explaining the problem that Waypost aims to solve. Development teams who create new features for software applications need to make data-driven decisions to ensure that their design choices benefit the business. They achieve this by analyzing the behavior of the application's users. However, to run experiments and gain insights, developers need to implement A/B testing and feature flags. The target organization that runs into this problem is a hypothetical solar panel company called Solar Flare.

## A/B Testing and Feature Flags
The presentation then dives into the concepts of A/B testing and feature flags. A/B testing is a common method used by product development teams to test the impact of a new feature. It involves experimenting with two or more versions of a feature and comparing metrics between the groups to determine if there is a significant difference. Feature flags, on the other hand, are toggles that turn functionality on or off without needing to redeploy the application. They allow developers to deliver different versions of their application and facilitate A/B testing.

## Solutions for Implementing A/B Testing
The presenters explain that Waypost provides a solution for implementing A/B testing using feature flags. They outline the components needed, such as a database to hold the feature flag data, a server to handle queries to the database, and a front-end interface for managing feature flags. Additionally, they introduce the concept of an SDK (Software Development Kit), which is a library of code that is imported into the application. The SDK communicates with the backend server to receive updated flags.

## Engineering Decisions and Discussion
Caleb then talks about the engineering decisions made while designing Waypost. They discuss the communication between the flag manager and flag provider, considering options like polling, message brokers, and webhooks. They ultimately decide to use webhooks as the communication method. They also explain the communication between the flag provider and SDK, using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time event-driven communication. Additionally, they discuss the design of the statistics pipeline for analyzing A/B test results using statistical tests.

## Deployment with Docker and Future Features
Sean explains the deployment process for Waypost using Docker and demonstrates how to set up the manager app, flag provider, and SDK. He also briefly mentions some future features they would like to include, such as separating flags for different applications and implementing login functionality for permissions and tracking edits to flag data.

## Conclusion and Q&A
The presenters conclude the video by thanking the audience and opening the floor for questions. They answer questions related to statistical analysis, implementation of the splitting required for A/B testing, and the load on the existing event database.

## ELI5 Summary
Waypost is a platform that helps developers make data-driven decisions by implementing A/B testing and feature flags. A/B testing allows developers to test different versions of a feature and compare the results, while feature flags allow them to turn features on or off without redeploying the application. Waypost provides a manager app for creating and managing feature flags, a flag provider for real-time updates, and SDKs for implementing feature flags in applications.

## Tools Used
- Docker: Used for deploying Waypost.
- Node.js: Used for the server-side SDK of Waypost.
- React: Used for the client-side SDK of Waypost.
- PostgreSQL: Used as the event database for storing user event data.
- SSE (Server-Sent Events): Used for real-time communication between the flag provider and SDK.
- GitHub: Used for version control and hosting the Waypost code repository.
- Launch Darkly: Mentioned as a third-party feature flagging platform alternative to building from scratch.
- GrowthBook: Mentioned as inspiration for the architecture of A/B testing in Waypost.
