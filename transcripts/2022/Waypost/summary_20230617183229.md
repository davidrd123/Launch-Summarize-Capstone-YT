# Waypost: Open Source Feature Flag Management Platform - Coding Capstone Project

## Transcript Analysis

### Overview of Waypost and the Problem it Solves

The presenters introduce Waypost, which is an open-source feature flag management platform designed for A/B testing. They explain that the purpose of Waypost is to allow developers to use feature flags to deliver two versions of their application, run experiments, and view the results to make informed decisions. They emphasize the need for data-driven decision-making and the importance of analyzing user behavior to determine the impact of design choices.

### A/B Testing and Feature Flags

The presenters explain the concept of A/B testing, which involves running experiments with two or more versions of a feature simultaneously. They describe how A/B testing can help development teams gather insights on the impact of design decisions on user behavior. Feature flags are introduced as a toggle that turns functionality on or off without needing to redeploy the application. They explain how feature flags allow developers to serve different versions of their application to users and control the rollout of new features.

### Challenges of A/B Testing and Solutions

The presenters discuss the challenges of A/B testing, including the need to randomly assign users to groups, track user experiences, log events, and analyze results statistically. They mention potential solutions used by companies, such as building their own platform or using third-party services. They explain the pros and cons of each approach, highlighting the trade-offs between control and flexibility, time and resource investment, and data privacy concerns.

### Waypost Architecture and Deployment

The presenter explains the architecture of Waypost, which includes the Manager Application, Flag Provider, and SDK components. They describe how the Manager Application is a full-stack application responsible for managing feature flags and experiments. The Flag Provider serves as a cache for flag data and communicates with the SDK clients to provide real-time updates. The SDK, available for both client-side (React) and server-side (Node), evaluates flags at runtime and allows for rendering different versions of the application.

They also provide a demonstration of how to deploy Waypost using Docker, explaining the steps to clone the Waypost Docker repository, run the Docker Compose file, install and configure the SDK in the existing application, and connect the Flag Provider and SDK.

### Running Experiments with Waypost

The presenter explains the process of running experiments with Waypost. They mention the need for existing user event data stored in a PostgreSQL database and the connection between the Manager Application and the events database. They demonstrate how to set up experiments in the Manager Application, including connecting the database, defining metrics, creating and starting an experiment on a feature flag. They also mention the importance of determining when to end an experiment, the sample size needed for reliable results, and running statistical analysis to determine the impact of the new feature.

### Engineering Decisions and Future Features

The presenter discusses some of the engineering decisions made while designing Waypost, including communication between the Manager Application and Flag Provider, communication between the Flag Provider and SDK, and the implementation of the statistics pipeline. They explain the trade-offs between different communication methods (polling, message broker, and web hooks) and the choice of using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for the Flag Provider-SDK communication. They also mention future features they plan to include in Waypost, such as separating flags for individual applications and adding login functionality.

## ELI5 Summary

Waypost is a platform that helps development teams test new features in their applications. It uses something called feature flags to turn features on and off without changing the code. This allows developers to deliver different versions of the application to users at the same time. Waypost also helps teams run experiments to see if the new features are working well. The platform collects data from users and analyzes it to make data-driven decisions. Waypost can be deployed using Docker, and it provides a user interface to manage feature flags and experiments. It also includes SDKs for React and Node to evaluate flags at runtime. Overall, Waypost helps development teams make informed decisions and improve their applications.
