## Introduction
The video starts with a warm welcome from Carolina, who introduces herself and her colleagues Julia, Marcus, and Will. They proceed to present Firefly, an open-source observability framework for serverless functions. The project aims to provide key insights into serverless function health by leveraging metrics and traces. The video outlines the topics to be covered, including foundational concepts, serverless observability, existing solutions, Firefly's architecture, and the challenges encountered during the project. 

## Foundational Concepts
The team begins by explaining the concepts of microservices and serverless architecture. Microservices involve a distributed architectural approach, where a single application consists of loosely coupled, independently deployable, and scalable services. On the other hand, serverless architecture is a development approach where applications are created and deployed without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Control and provisioning of servers are handed off to third-party cloud providers.

The team emphasizes that serverless microservices often utilize serverless functions, which are small pieces of code that can be invoked asynchronously based on events. They introduce the concept of Functions as a Service (FaaS), which is a cloud-based service that hosts and manages serverless functions. FaaS providers automate the provisioning and scaling of computation resources based on demand.

However, accessing and modifying the cloud provider's environment and infrastructure in serverless architecture can become challenging. Data collection about serverless functions requires a different set of strategies compared to traditional architectures. The team highlights the importance of observability, which is the measure of how well one can understand and explain any state the application can get into, and how telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) can help achieve this.

## Serverless Observability
Julia takes over to discuss the importance of serverless observability and the challenges it presents. Observability involves understanding the state of the application and the requests passing through it by emitting and collecting telemetry data. Metrics are generic quantifiable measurements that reflect the health of infrastructure, while logs provide granular insights into specific events. Traces, on the other hand, allow tracking a single request as it moves through different parts of an application.

The team explores the challenges of serverless observability, starting with the instrentation approach. In traditional hosted applications, observability strategies can install agents within the application's environment to generate telemetry data. However, this is not suitable for serverless functions as they lack access to the underlying infrastructure and are ephemeral and stateless. The team also tackles the challenges of context propagation, which involves passing context information between services in a distributed system. They explain the difficulties in achieving context propagation for serverless functions invoked asynchronously, as the information is not always available in the events.

The team then explores existing solutions for serverless observability. AWS CloudWatch is a popular native observability solution provided by AWS, but it comes with unpredictable costs and lacks a global overview of telemetry data. They mention Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, which offer easy automated setup, managed data pipelines, and comprehensive feature sets. However, SaaS solutions also come with high costs and potential data control and ownership issues. Lastly, they present do-it-yourself (DIY) solutions, which provide control, freedom, and flexibility, but require significant effort in setup and configuration.

## Firefly
In the next segment, Marcus introduces Firefly, the team's open-source observability framework for serverless functions. Firefly aims to provide key insights into serverless function health by automating instrentation and deploying a telemetry pipeline. To use Firefly, users deploy the telemetry pipeline using Docker and run Firefly's command-line interface to instrument their functions. Firefly leverages Grafana as its monitoring and visualization tool, allowing users to view their telemetry data in easy-to-use dashboards.

Marcus describes Firefly's main goals, focusing on ease of deployment and vendor agnosticism. Firefly narrows its scope to AWS Lambda functions, as AWS holds a significant share of the cloud market. The team highlights that Firefly focuses on metrics and traces, not logs, for observability. They demonstrate Firefly's main dashboard, which provides a general overview of all serverless functions, including key metrics. They also showcase function-specific dashboards with additional metrics and trace data.

## Challenges and Future Work
Will takes over to discuss the technical challenges encountered while developing Firefly. He highlights the challenges of distributed tracing and context propagation. Distributed tracing involves tracking a request across a system, and context propagation is the means by which this is achieved. Firefly faced difficulties in context propagation due to AWS-specific headers, but they were able to solve this by switching to the W3C Trace Context propagation method.

Will also mentions challenges related to serverless functions invoked via SQS, SNS, and the AWS SDK. Firefly had to handle context propagation differently for these invocation methods and wrapped functions to inject the trace parent header into the payload for AWS SDK-invoked functions. The team summarizes their goals for future work, including extending language support, offering observability solutions for other serverless function providers, and improving metric emission via Firefly's Lambda layer.

## Summary and Tools Used
To summarize, the team presented Firefly, an open-source observability framework for serverless functions. Firefly helps track serverless function health by leveraging metrics and traces. They explained foundational concepts, the importance of serverless observability, existing solutions, and Firefly's architecture. The team discussed challenges faced during the project, such as distributed tracing and context propagation. They concluded by highlighting future work, including language support extensions and integrations with different serverless function providers.

Specific tools used in the project:
- Open Telemetry: An open-source toolchain for generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data.
- AWS Distro for Open Telemetry (ADOT): An AWS-specific version of the Open Telemetry collector that handles tracing and context propagation for AWS Lambda functions.
- AWS Lambda Layers: A way to package code to be used within AWS Lambda functions.
- Prometheus: A system for monitoring and alerting, used to receive and process telemetry data in Prometheus format.
- Grafana: A monitoring and visualization tool used to create dashboards for serverless functions.
- AWS CloudWatch: A native observability solution provided by AWS, used for metrics collection and stream data.
- AWS Kinesis Data Firehose: A fully managed service used to receive and process streaming data, used to receive telemetry data from AWS CloudWatch metric stream.
- AWS SDK: Software development kits provided by AWS, used for invoking serverless functions.
- W3C Trace Context: A propagation method used to pass context information between services.

ELI5 Summary:

Firefly is a tool to help people understand and improve the health of their serverless functions. It does this by keeping an eye on the functions and collecting data about how they are doing. Firefly uses different kinds of data, like metrics that measure the health of the functions, and traces that show how requests move through the functions. The team faced some challenges, like making sure the data is passed correctly between different parts of the system, but they found solutions for these challenges. Overall, Firefly is a useful tool to keep track of serverless functions and make sure they are working well.
