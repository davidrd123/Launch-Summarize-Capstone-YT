# Analyzing Coding Capstone Project Video

## Introduction

The video transcript presents a coding Capstone project called "Triage," which is an efficient proxy for solving head-of-line blocking for Kafka consumers. The team members (Ashish, Aryan, Jordan, and Michael) provide an overview of microservice architecture, event-driven architecture, message queues, and Apache Kafka. They then discuss the problem of head-of-line blocking and its consequences, followed by an exploration of existing solutions. Finally, they present "Triage" along with some design challenges they faced and propose ideas for future work.

## Context: Microservice Architecture and Event-Driven Architecture

Microservice architecture has become popular in recent years, with around 63% of enterprises adopting it in 2020. The architecture involves isolating separate services into different pieces, allowing for parallel development and scalability. Multiple technologies and programming languages can be used in these setups, creating a polyglot microservice environment. To achieve inter-service communication, one option is the request-response model commonly used on the web. However, this model faces the challenge of head-of-line blocking when one service experiences slowdown, affecting the entire system.

To overcome head-of-line blocking and decouple services, an event-driven architecture (EDA) can be implemented. EDAs center around events, which are changes in state or notifications about a change. Services can operate independently without worrying about the state of other services. Message queues are often used in EDAs, and Apache Kafka is a popular choice. Kafka uses message topics and partitions to achieve scalability and maintain decoupling.

## Apache Kafka Overview

Kafka is a message queue designed for scalability and parallelism. Messages in Kafka are referred to as "events," and they are grouped using a topic identifier. Kafka routes messages to partitions, allowing for parallel processing. Producers write messages to topics, and consumers can subscribe to specific topics and read messages from partitions. Multiple consumer instances can process messages in parallel, improving scalability. Kafka uses offsets to track the processing of messages and ensures that message delivery can be resumed after a crash or failure.

## Problem of Head-of-Line Blocking

Head-of-line blocking refers to a situation where the slow processing of one message in a message queue delays the processing of subsequent messages. This can occur due to poison pills (messages that cannot be handled) or non-uniform consumer latency. Poison pills cause the consumer application to crash, preventing the processing of subsequent messages. Non-uniform consumer latency arises when certain messages trigger external service calls that have variable response times, delaying the processing of other messages.

## Existing Solutions and Their Limitations

The team researched existing solutions that address head-of-line blocking in Kafka consumers. Three solutions were identified: Confluent Parallel Consumer, Doordash's Worker Model, and Uber's Consumer Proxy.

- Confluent Parallel Consumer: This solution handles both poison pills and non-uniform consumer latency. However, it does not store poison pill messages and may result in data loss. Additionally, it is written in Java, limiting its use in polyglot microservice environments.
- Doordash's Worker Model: This solution addresses non-uniform consumer latency by introducing "Costco workers" that can handle slow messages. However, it does not handle poison pills and lacks a mechanism to prevent data loss.
- Uber's Consumer Proxy: This solution solves both poison pill and non-uniform consumer latency issues. It handles poison pills without data loss and achieves parallel consumption of messages. However, it is an in-house solution and not available for external developers.

## Introducing Triage: A Solution to Head-of-Line Blocking

Given the limitations of existing solutions, the team decided to build their own solution called "Triage." Triage acts as a proxy for Kafka consumer applications, ingesting messages from the Kafka cluster and forwarding them to downstream consumer applications. The main components of Triage include the application logic running in an AWS container and a DynamoDB instance for storing problematic messages.

To manage commits back to Kafka, Triage utilizes an internal system called "Commit Tracker." Consumers send acknowledgments (Ack or Nack) to Triage, indicating the successful or unsuccessful processing of a message. The Commit Tracker keeps track of the committed offsets, ensuring the health of the partition. Triage achieves parallel consumption by utilizing concurrency in Go, with each consumer instance running as a separate Go routine. The Go routines communicate using channels, which enables non-blocking function loops.

## Challenges Faced and Future Work

During the development of Triage, several challenges were encountered:

1. Achieving Parallel Processing via Concurrency: The team needed to establish a one-to-many relationship between Triage and consumer instances to solve non-uniform consumer latency. They chose Go due to its built-in support for concurrency using Go routines and channels.

2. Polyglot Support: Since microservice environments often involve multiple programming languages, the team aimed to make Triage easily integratable with different languages. Triage was implemented as a service, coupled with a thin client library that communicates with Triage using gRPC (a remote procedure call framework). The team utilized gRPC's code generation feature to support multiple languages.

3. Ease of Deployment: Triage needed to be deployed for each partition in a Kafka topic. The team used AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate to deploy Triage containers. To make deployment easier for developers, they created an automated deployment script using AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) and a command-line tool called Triage CLI. The CLI tool allows developers to easily configure and deploy Triage to AWS.

For future work, the team plans to add additional language support for the Triage client library, enhance the dead letter table to include failure causes, and implement a notification system to alert developers about poison pill messages.

## ELI5 Summary

Triage is a solution to a problem called "head-of-line blocking," which occurs when one slow message delays the processing of other messages. It is designed for microservice architectures using Kafka message queues. Triage acts as a middleman between Kafka and consumer applications, ensuring efficient message processing. It solves two major causes of head-of-line blocking: "poison pills" (messages that cause errors) and non-uniform consumer latency (variations in message processing time). Triage achieves parallel processing using concurrency in Go, supports multiple programming languages, and can be easily deployed using AWS services.

## Tools Used

The project utilized the following tools:

- Languages: Go (for Triage application logic) and gRPC (for communication between Triage and consumer applications).
- Cloud Services: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate, DynamoDB, and Cloud Development Kit (CDK).
- Other Technologies: Apache Kafka (as the message queue), Confluent Parallel Consumer library, Doordash's Worker Model, and Uber's Consumer Proxy.

Overall, the team built Triage as a practical and efficient solution to head-of-line blocking in Kafka consumer applications, addressing common challenges and providing a seamless integration experience for developers.
