# Capstone Project: Chimera - Automated Canary Deployments for Containerized Microservices

**Overview**: 
Chimera is an open-source tool for automated canary deployments of containerized microservices in a service mesh environment. This capstone project aims to simplify the process of canary deployments by integrating with various tools and services to automate the deployment, traffic routing, and monitoring processes. The team behind Chimera presents an overview of microservice architectures and different deployment methods, discusses the challenges faced, and provides a hands-on demonstration of using Chimera.

## ELI5 Summary:
Chimera is a tool that makes it easier and safer to update and deploy new versions of software, specifically for containerized microservices. It does this by gradually introducing changes to the software, instead of doing it all at once. This way, if there are any problems, they can be detected and fixed quickly without affecting all users. Chimera works with other tools like Kubernetes (for managing the software), load balancers (for distributing traffic), and monitoring systems (for tracking the health of the new version). It automates the process of deploying the new version, gradually shifting the traffic to it, and monitoring its performance. This allows developers to make changes and updates to their software more confidently.
