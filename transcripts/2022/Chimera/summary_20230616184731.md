# Analysis of Coding Capstone Project Video

## Introduction
The video is a presentation of a coding Capstone project called "Chimera." Chimera is an open-source tool designed for performing automated canary deployments of containerized microservices that communicate through a service mesh. The video is broken down into several sections, including an introduction to microservice architectures, an explanation of canary deployments, and an overview of the challenges and design decisions faced while building Chimera. The presentation concludes with a discussion of the tools used in the project and potential future directions.

## ELI5 Summary
Chimera is a tool that helps developers deploy and update their containerized microservices in a structured and automated way. It uses a concept called "canary deployments," where a new version of the microservice is gradually introduced to a small portion of the users, allowing for continuous testing and monitoring. If any errors or issues are detected, the deployment can be quickly rolled back to the stable version. Chimera integrates with popular container orchestration tools like Kubernetes and AWS Elastic Container Service, as well as service mesh tools like AWS App Mesh. It simplifies the deployment process and provides a user-friendly interface for developers to configure and monitor their deployments.

## Tools Used
- Container Orchestrators: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)
- Service Mesh: AWS App Mesh
- Monitoring: AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus
- Deployment Automation: Docker, Docker Compose
- Infrastructure as Code: AWS CloudFormation, AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), AWS SDK (Software Development Kit)

## Detailed Explanation

### Microservice Architectures
The presenter begins by introducing microservice architectures, where the system is divided into isolated applications called microservices that communicate via network requests. Managing communication between these microservices is a complex task in microservice architectures. Service meshes are tools that help simplify this communication by abstracting away the complexity of traffic routing and inter-service communication.

### Canary Deployments
The presenter explains canary deployments, which are a type of deployment strategy in microservice architectures. In a canary deployment, a new version of the application, known as the "canary," is gradually introduced in a controlled manner to a small portion of the users, while the majority of the users continue using the stable version. This allows for testing and monitoring of the new version before it is fully deployed. If any issues or errors are detected, the deployment can be quickly rolled back to the stable version.

### Challenges in Canary Deployments
The presenter highlights the challenges faced during canaray deployments. Traditional approaches to deployment, such as "all at once" deployments, can lead to downtime and errors affecting all users. The presenter explains the challenges of downtime, error impact, and rollback in all at once deployments.

### Solutions for Canary Deployments
The presenter introduces popular solutions for canary deployments. They discuss "blue-green deployments," where a whole new environment is created to host the new version of the application, and traffic is gradually shifted from the old version to the new version. They also discuss "rolling deployments," where updates are made to one instance at a time, gradually updating the entire system. Finally, they introduce "canary deployments," where a small portion of the traffic is shifted to the canary version, allowing for testing and monitoring before fully deploying the new version.

### Tools for Containerized Microservices
The presenter explains the components involved in canary deployments for containerized microservices. They mention the need for a container orchestration tool (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, AWS ECS) to manage the deployment and scaling of the microservices. They also mention the need for a traffic routing tool (e.g., Load Balancer) to handle the routing of traffic between microservices. Additionally, they discuss the role of a monitoring tool (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus) to track the health and performance of the microservices. Finally, they mention the need for a canary management tool (e.g., Chimera) to automate the deployment and monitoring process.

### Introduction to Chimera
The presenter introduces Chimera as a tool designed to automate canary deployments for containerized microservices. They mention that Chimera integrates with container orchestration tools like AWS ECS and service mesh tools like AWS App Mesh. They highlight the key features of Chimera, including simplified deployment process, minimal impact on existing infrastructure, and easy-to-understand canary analysis.

### Using Chimera
Another presenter takes over to demonstrate the usage of Chimera from the perspective of a developer. They explain that Chimera has been dockerized for easy installation and usage. Developers only need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed to start using Chimera. The presenter walks through the process of deploying a canary version of a microservice using Chimera. They show how Chimera interacts with AWS, deploys the canary version, monitors its metrics, and handles successful deployments and rollbacks.

### Challenges and Design Decisions
The final presenter discusses the challenges and design decisions faced while building Chimera. They talk about the decision to use the AWS SDK for interacting with AWS resources, which allowed Chimera to have more control over the deployment process and metrics collection. They explain the use of Prometheus to collect metrics from envoy proxies in AWS ECS, simplifying the infrastructure required for Chimera. They mention the decision to focus on error rate as the primary health check metric, considering factors like saturation and traffic to be more complex or less aligned with the goal of minimizing the impact of errors. Finally, they discuss the decision to use threshold analysis instead of comparison-based analysis for canary deployments to simplify the deployment process.

### Future Features
The presenter concludes by mentioning future features that could be added to Chimera. They discuss the possibility of automating canary deployments in response to specific events and the addition of webhook features for sending deployment status notifications to external tools like Slack.
