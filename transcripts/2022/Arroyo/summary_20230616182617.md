# Arroyo - A Lightweight Framework for Log Rehydration

## Introduction
Arroyo is a lightweight framework developed by Team Arroyo, consisting of Ann, Dawn, Olga, and Pauline. The framework is designed for the granular rehydration of logs, specifically stored in AWS S3. This transcript is from a coding Capstone project video, where the team explains the concept of Arroyo and its applications.

## MEANLY - The Fictional Image and Video Hosting Service
The video begins by introducing Meanly, a fictional image and video hosting service, which aims to consolidate popular content from across the web. As Meanly started scaling their infrastructure, they realized the need for better observability and oversight.

## Observability and the ELK Stack
The concept of observability is then discussed, focusing on the three pillars: metrics, traces, and logs. Logs, in particular, provide a detailed view of what is happening in an application, making them useful for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.

The team then dives into the ELK stack, which stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Logstash is a data collection engine, Elasticsearch is a distributed document store and search engine, and Kibana is a user interface for visualizing and exploring data stored in Elasticsearch. These three tools are commonly used to manage logs, allowing for centralization, searchability, and analysis of log data.

## Log Rehydration and Existing Solutions
The video then addresses the challenge of log rehydration, which is the process of transferring archived logs back into Elasticsearch for easier searching. While there are commercial observability solutions that offer log rehydration features, they may come with limitations such as cost, complexity, and time to learn new technology stacks. On the other hand, open-source tools could be used to build a DIY solution, but the team may not have the time and resources to research and implement it.

## Arroyo - The Granular Log Rehydration Framework
Arroyo is presented as a solution that strikes a balance between the ease of a commercial solution and the ability to keep the existing ELK stack. Arroyo offers two options: bulk rehydration and query rehydration.

The bulk rehydration option allows users to specify a time frame and re-ingest the entire contents of selected log files from their S3 bucket into Elasticsearch. This option is useful for trend analysis and developing new metrics with historical context.

The query rehydration option, on the other hand, allows users to search logs by date range and provide up to two queries to conditionally re-ingest logs. This option reduces data bloat by rehydrating only the most relevant logs and provides a more granular level of control.

## Arroyo Architecture and Technical Deep Dive
The video then delves into the technical details of Arroyo's architecture. It starts by explaining how the application processes rehydration requests through three key phases: rehydrate, re-ingest, and notify.

During the rehydrate phase, the user submits a rehydration request using the Arroyo UI. The request is then forwarded to the Arroyo server, which interacts with AWS resources to facilitate the rehydration and re-ingestion of logs. The logs are fetched from the S3 bucket using SQL queries or by fetching the entire file.

Once the logs are rehydrated, they are forwarded to Logstash through a POST request sent by a Lambda function. After indexing by Elasticsearch, the logs become searchable in the Kibana dashboard. Lastly, the client is notified of the completion of the rehydration job through a server-sent event.

Some of the engineering decisions made while developing Arroyo are discussed, including the use of AWS SQS as a buffer and AWS Lambda for rehydration and re-ingestion tasks. Dead-letter queues are used to handle problematic messages, and SQS is leveraged for queue management.

## Future Plans
The team concludes the video by discussing future plans for Arroyo. They aim to improve visibility into the jobs and provide a more robust searching capability, including full-text log searching and complex query support. Additionally, they plan to expand integration capabilities to fetch logs from other cloud storage vendors to increase flexibility.

## ELI5 Summary
Arroyo is a framework for rehydrating logs, which means bringing stored logs back into a usable and searchable format. It is specifically designed to work with the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), which is commonly used for managing logs. Arroyo provides two options for rehydration: bulk rehydration, which allows for analyzing trends and metrics with historical data, and query rehydration, which enables users to selectively re-ingest relevant logs based on specific criteria. The framework uses AWS services like S3, SQS, and Lambda to facilitate the rehydration process. The team plans to improve job visibility, enhance search capabilities, and expand integration options in the future.
