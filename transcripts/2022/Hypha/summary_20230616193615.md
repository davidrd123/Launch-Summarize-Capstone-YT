# Coding Capstone Project Video Analysis

## Introduction

The video is a presentation of a coding Capstone project called "Haifa." The project team consists of Yulia, Josh, Steve, and Isaac. Haifa is an open-source observability framework that sets up distributed tracing and a telemetry pipeline to aggregate logs and correlate them with traces. The project aims to provide a powerful debugging workflow through a simple user interface.

## Presentation Outline

The presentation starts with Yulia giving an overview of observability and explaining some foundational concepts. Josh then tells a story of a fictional health tech startup to illustrate the problem Haifa solves. Isaac explains the process of creating a telemetry pipeline and discusses existing solutions in this space. Steve gives a tour of Haifa's architecture, and Yulia discusses the engineering challenges and future work for Haifa.

## Observability

Yulia explains that observability in the software industry refers to the ability to infer the internal states of a system from its external outputs. Since software systems are like black boxes, it is difficult to know what is happening internally. To improve observability, data needs to be outputted from the system, known as telemetry. The three types of telemetry are logs, metrics, and traces.

## Haifa's Features

1. Simple UI for powerful debugging workflow.
2. Aggregates logs and correlates them with traces.
3. Sets up distributed tracing and telemetry pipeline.
4. Provides an open-source and customizable solution.
5. Easy to set up and use.
6. Offers data ownership and control.

## Tools Used

1. Open Telemetry: Used for instrentation, tracing, and collecting telemetry data.
2. Grafana: Used for visualizing and querying logs and traces.
3. Jaeger: Used as the tracing tool to visualize distributed traces.
4. Loki: Used as the log storage and querying tool.
5. Docker: Used for containerizing Haifa for easy deployment.
6. AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS): Used as the deployment platform on AWS.

## ELI5 Summary

Haifa is like a detective for software problems. It helps developers understand what's happening inside their software, even if it's like a black box. It does this by collecting three types of information: logs, metrics, and traces. Logs are like little notes that tell us what's happening at different times. Metrics are like numbers that show us how well the software is doing. And traces show us the path that data takes through the software. Haifa puts all this information together and makes it easier to find and fix problems in the software.

## Conclusion

Haifa is an open-source observability framework that provides developers with a simple UI and powerful debugging capabilities. It sets up distributed tracing and a telemetry pipeline to aggregate logs and correlate them with traces. The project offers an easy-to-use solution with features like data ownership, customization, and deployment automation. The specific tools used include Open Telemetry, Grafana, Jaeger, Loki, Docker, and AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS).
