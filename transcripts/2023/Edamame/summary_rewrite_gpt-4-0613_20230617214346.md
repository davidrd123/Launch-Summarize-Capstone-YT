# Project Video Analysis: Edamame - A Load Testing Tool for Real-Time Collaboration Applications

## Introduction

The project video details the development of Edamame, a load testing tool specifically designed for real-time collaboration applications. The team, made up of Albert, Ginny, Luke, and Rachel, presents the purpose, development process and outcomes of Edamame.

## Load Testing and Its Significance - Presented by Rachel 

Load testing is a process of simulating user behavior at high scales to evaluate the system's response. The primary aim is to identify performance issues in applications, examining factors like scale, protocols, associated metrics, and data visualization methods. 

When load testing is applied to real-time collaboration applications such as Slack, Miro, and Coda, it necessitates the inclusion of additional protocols, for instance, websockets. 

## The Development and Architecture of Edamame - Presented by Albert 

The architecture of Edamame includes three primary components:

1. Load generator: Simulates virtual user behaviors.
2. Workload orchestrator: Manages the actions and behavior of the simulated users during the test.
3. Metrics collector: Gathers crucial data for analysis and visualization.

The challenges faced during the development and how they were solved through architecture design were also presented. 

## Real-Time Collaboration Apps and Unique Load Testing Challenges - Presented by Ginny

Real-time collaboration applications rely on websockets for creating persistent connections for real-time communication. It allows bidirectional communication, a feature often required by collaboration applications for enhancing user experience. 

A unique challenge encountered in the load testing of such applications is the 'fan-out' effect due to the message distribution via the websocket protocol in real-time.

## Edamame in Action - Presented by Albert 

Albert presented the high-level architecture of Edamame and its specific applications. The solution is built in a modular format, including a load generator, an orchestrator for workload management, and a metric collector.

He also elaborated on how Edamame overcame the specific challenges encountered during development. These challenges included managing the scalability and synchronization of the load generators and integrating the collection and visualization of metrics.

## ELI5 Summary

Like doctors use stethoscopes to see if a human heart is healthy, developers use load testing tools to check if a software application can handle many users at once before it fails. Edamame is a tool used by developers to check the "health" of collaboration apps like Slack or Miro (imagine a Skype or Whatsapp that has features for working together with your colleagues). This tool takes on the roles of many users and uses the application just like them to see if it can succeed or fails.
