# Analysis of Coding Capstone Project Video Transcript

## Introduction

The video discusses the development of Edamame, a load testing tool for real-time collaboration applications. The team consists of Albert, Ginny, Luke, and Rachel, representing different parts of Canada and the US. The video is divided into two parts: Part A focuses on load testing and its significance for collaboration applications, while Part B outlines the solution architecture of Edamame.

## Part A: Load Testing and Collaboration Applications

The team begins by defining load testing as the process of simulating user behavior at high volumes to evaluate how a system responds. Load testing helps developers identify performance issues and ensure that the application can handle high traffic. The team mentions that load testing for collaboration applications, such as Slack, Coda, and Miro, presents unique considerations due to the use of additional protocols like websockets.

The team discusses the key considerations for load testing collaboration apps:

1. Scale: Load testing involves defining the number of virtual users simulated during the test. The team mentions that the precise number of virtual users that can be simulated depends on available resources like CPU and memory.

2. Protocols: Collaboration apps often require additional protocols like websockets for real-time communication. Load testers need to modify their test scripts to accurately simulate these protocols.

3. Metrics: Developers need to carefully choose and collect relevant metrics during load testing. Server-side data like CPU and memory usage provides backend performance metrics, while client-side data like response times directly impact user experience.

4. Visualization: Visualizing data collected during load testing is crucial for gaining insights into system performance. Developers can present data as summaries or graphs that plot data against time.

The team emphasizes the importance of considering these factors when conducting load tests, depending on the developer's use case. They explain that Edamame focuses on load testing collaboration apps and will address the unique challenges associated with them.

## Part B: Solution Architecture of Edamame

In this part, the team outlines the high-level architecture of Edamame and discusses the challenges they encountered during the development process. They mention that Edamame is designed to accurately emulate real-time collaboration scenarios.

The core components of Edamame include:

1. Load Generator: Simulates virtual users for the load test.
2. Workload Orchestrator: Manages the behavior and actions of virtual users during the test.
3. Metrics Collector: Gathers relevant data for analysis and visualization.

The team highlights three challenges faced during development:

1. Scalability and Synchronization: Managing the scalability and synchronization of load generators to simulate large-scale tests effectively. They address this challenge by implementing a distributed architecture that allows load generators to run on multiple machines and be centrally orchestrated.

2. Fan-Out Effect: Accurately simulating the behavior of virtual users in collaboration apps, which includes efficiently handling the fan-out effect. The team developed custom logic within the workload orchestrator to ensure proper message distribution.

3. Metrics Collection and Visualization: Integrating the collection and visualization of metrics during load testing. They implemented a metrics collector to efficiently capture data and a visualizer to provide near real-time insights into system performance.

The team concludes by mentioning that Edamame enables developers to conduct comprehensive load tests for real-time collaboration apps. Despite the challenges, its modular architecture and custom logic ensure accurate emulation of user behavior, efficient fan-out handling, and meaningful metric collection.

## ELI5 Summary

Edamame is a tool that helps developers test how well apps work when many people are using them at the same time. It's designed specifically for apps where people need to work together in real-time. The tool creates fake users who interact with the app and sees how it responds. Edamame is made up of different parts that work together to generate the fake users, manage what they do, and collect information about how the app is performing. It's important to test these types of apps because they often use a special way of talking to the server that's different from regular websites. Edamame makes it easier to do this type of testing and helps developers find problems before the app is used by lots of people.

## Tools Used

### Cloud Services
1. Amazon Web Services (AWS): Edamame is designed to run on AWS, and users need to set up the cloud infrastructure on AWS to use the tool effectively.

### Languages
1. Go: The team extended the load testing tool k6 by writing a custom extension in Go to add the necessary metrics for websockets load testing.
2. Shell (Bash): The team utilized shell scripting to automate tasks and setup processes in Edamame.

### Other Technologies
1. k6: A load testing tool used as the load generator in Edamame. It generates HTTP and websocket traffic to simulate user behavior.
2. Kubernetes: Used for managing and orchestrating the behavior of load generators running on multiple machines in a distributed load test setup.
3. Docker: Used to create containers that encapsulate dependencies and provide a standardized environment for load generators in a distributed load test setup.
4. Statsite: A performance stats D server written in C that is used for central aggregation of performance metrics in Edamame, allowing for efficient processing and visualization of data.
5. Grafana: A popular open-source data visualization tool used in Edamame to create near real-time dashboards for monitoring load test results.

Note: The team mentions that there are other load testing options available, such as managed cloud-based services like k6 Cloud, BlazeMeter, and Gatling Enterprise, as well as self-hosted DIY tools. However, they focus on Edamame as a self-hosted distributed load testing framework specifically designed for real-time collaboration apps.
