# Coding Capstone Project Transcript Analysis

## Introduction
The video is a transcript of a coding Capstone project presentation. The project is focused on building a load tester called edamame for real-time collaboration apps. The presenters discuss the problem domain, outline their solution, and highlight the specific challenges they faced and the tools used. The presentation is divided into two main parts: laying out the problem (Part A) and outlining their solution (Part B).

## Part A: Laying Out the Problem

### 1. Defining Load Testing
The presenters start by defining load testing as the process of simulating real application user behavior at large volumes and measuring how the system responds. They explain that load tests help companies prepare for overwhelming traffic and ensure great user experience.

### 2. Real-Time Collaboration Apps
The presenters discuss real-time collaboration apps like Slack, Coda, and Miro, which incorporate real-time communication and enable users to collaborate in real time. They explain why they focused on these apps, emphasizing the rise of remote work and the increasing use of collaboration tools.

### 3. Load Testing Considerations for Collaboration Apps
The presenters explain that load testing collaboration apps requires additional considerations due to the nature of real-time applications. Collaboration apps often use additional protocols like websockets to facilitate real-time communication, making load testing more complex.

### 4. Existing Solutions for Load Testing Collaboration Apps
The presenters provide an overview of existing solutions for load testing collaboration apps. They discuss managed cloud-based services, self-hosted DIY tools, and licensed or open-source solutions. They highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and introduce edamame as a self-hosted, open-source load testing framework.

## Part B: Outline of the Solution

### 1. High-Level Architecture of Edamame
The presenters provide an overview of how edamame is set up and how it works. They explain that edamame runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and uses Docker containers on EC2 instances to run the load tests. Edamame includes components for load generation, data handling, and data visualization.

### 2. Challenges and Solutions
The presenters discuss the three major challenges they faced and how they solved them in the development of edamame.

#### Challenge 1: Coordinating Distributed Load Tests
The first challenge was coordinating distributed load tests of more than 100K virtual users. They explain how they used the k6 operator in Kubernetes to synchronize the tests running on different machines.

#### Challenge 2: Processing Large Data Points in Real Time
The second challenge was processing more than 1 million data points per second in real time. They explored different approaches, including writing raw data to a database, aggregating on the k6 runners, and central aggregation using stat site. Ultimately, they used stat site, a performance stats D server, to process and aggregate the data in real time.

#### Challenge 3: Extracting Useful Insights across Multiple Protocols
The third challenge was extracting useful insights from both HTTP and websockets during load tests. They extended k6, the load testing tool they used, to add custom metrics for websockets and visualize the data in Grafana.

## Conclusion

Edamame is a self-hosted, open-source load testing framework specifically designed for real-time collaboration apps. It addresses the challenges of coordinating load tests, processing large data points in real time, and extracting insights from multiple protocols. While edamame has its limitations, such as the number of users it can handle and the protocols it supports, it provides a competitive solution for load testing collaboration apps.

### ELI5 Summary
Edamame is a special tool that helps companies test apps where people work together in real time. It makes sure the apps can handle lots of people using them at the same time. Edamame uses a bunch of computers on a cloud to run the test and analyzes all the data to tell if the app is working well or not. It can test up to 200,000 people using the app at once. Edamame also measures things like how fast the app responds and if it's connecting properly. It shows the results on a dashboard so the developers can see if anything needs fixing.

### Specific Tools Used
- Cloud Services: Amazon Web Services (AWS), EC2 instances, Kubernetes, k6 operator, stat-site
- Languages: Go (writing extensions), C (stat-site)
- Other Technologies: Docker containers, Grafana, GitHub
