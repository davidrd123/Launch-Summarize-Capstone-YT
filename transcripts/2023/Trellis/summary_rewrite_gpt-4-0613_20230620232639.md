# Trellis: A Low-Config Deployment Pipeline for Serverless Applications

This report provides a detailed analysis of a capstone project video presentation chronicling the development of Trellis—an open source, low-configuration deployment pipeline designed to aid teams developing serverless applications. Hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Trellis is designed to streamline the deployment process of serverless applications.

## ELI5 Summary

Trellis is like a platform that reduces the steps that programmers or development teams have to take to put their code/applications on the internet. It acts like a traffic manager by controlling the flow of software updates. It makes sure that changes made to the software are working correctly before pushing them out for everyone to use. If there are any problems with the updates, Trellis helps developers roll back to a previous working version of the software. 

## Specific tools used in the project

- **Serverless Stack Framework (SST)**: Used to define the resources that make up a serverless application
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Provides the cloud platform for hosting the application
  - **AWS Fargate**: Provides on-demand, right-sized compute capacity for containers that form the application
  - **AWS Secrets Manager**: Used to securely store the credentials necessary for deploying AWS resources
  - **AWS CloudWatch**: Captures logs of the build process, providing crucial information for debugging and monitoring
  - **Amazon's Cloud Development Kit (CDK)**: Enables developers to use high-level construct to define cloud resources in code
  - **AWS API Gateway**: Serves as the front door for the backend, allowing developers to create and secure APIs
  - **AWS DynamoDB**: Stores deployment pipeline data
  - **AWS Lambda Functions**: Would allow pipelines to run at scale
  - **AWS CloudFront**: A content delivery network used to serve the Trellis dashboard
  - **AWS S3**: Stores the Trellis dashboard code
  - **AWS Elastic File System or S3 Bucket**: Planned to be used for caching application dependencies in future iterations
- **GitHub**: Used as the version control system that serves as a single source of truth for the application's codebase
- **React**: Utilized to implement the single-page application that makes up the Trellis dashboard
- **Travis CI, CircleCI, Seed, Jenkins**: Mentioned as alternatives for pre-configured third-party or SaaS deployment pipelines

## Introduction

Trellis is an application that aims to automate the deployment of software to the cloud. The purpose of an automated deployment pipeline is to deliver code changes automatically, smoothly integrating them into the existing codebase and deploying them to the necessary infrastructure. The final application users receive should reflect all the changes securely and efficiently. Trellis is specifically designed to simplify this process for serverless applications hosted on AWS.

## Technical Background

Traditionally, the process of developing software and preparing it for end users (deployment) were handled by distinct teams—developers and operations, respectively. This segregation of roles often caused delays as the operations team needed time to discover and address problems found by the developers. 

The advent of the DevOps philosophy, which merges development and operations roles into a single team, aimed to reduce this friction. The pipeline Trellis builds upon includes practices such as continuous integration and delivery. All changes to the code are committed to a shared repository in a version control system like GitHub, which serves as a reliable source for a comprehensive artifact that can be deployed as a full application. Trellis further enhances these practices by providing real-time updates and log details for enhanced clarity.

## Application Decision Process

One of the team's considerations was the application infrastructure to be used—on-premise, cloud-hosted, or serverless. They defaulted to using a serverless model, running on abstracted services in the AWS infrastructure. Key benefits of serverless include the pay-as-you-go nature that lessens the financial burden and the omission of physical servers, thereby eliminating the need for maintenance.

Developing a custom solution using open-source tools or leveraging a third-party solution such as Travis CI or Circle CI were other options considered. Eventually, owing to the aim of simplicity and cost-effectiveness, the team developed Trellis to be a niche-targeting open-source solution with user control over infrastructure and data.

## Functionalities of Trellis

Trellis is connected to users' GitHub repositories, linking by default to the main branch of the selected repository for the development environment. Updates to code are automatically detected and deployed to the related environment. Users can also manually deploy a specific commit to an environment if necessary.

The performance of code in each environment can be monitored, and users can proactively promote code to the next environment if they are confident in its stability. To prevent potential bugs being rolled out in a public-facing production environment, Trellis only allows manual promotions to production. If difficulties arise, users can roll back to a previous version using the rollback function provided in each environment. 

Apart from these, Trellis also ensures that the deployment process is efficient and user-friendly, with the provision of key functionalities such as unit testing per environment, tear-down options, and a UI that provides real-time monitoring of code deployments.

## Architecture of Trellis
Trellis is built on AWS and leverages AWS services such as lambda functions, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Fargate, to name a few. The architecture of Trellis consists of a build server, dashboard, and backend.

The build server handles the deployment of code to target environments and the management of rollbacks and teardowns.

The dashboard interface acts as a frontend to the backend. It provides an interface for users to trigger manual steps of the deployment pipeline, customize deployment environments, manage pipeline features, and monitor deployment statuses.

The backend caters to a spectrum of roles such as authentication, application management, environment promotion, and GitHub integration. Most of these roles are handled by separate lambda functions.

## Engineering Decisions and Trade-Offs

The project explored various options for specific features of Trellis, which led to a series of trade-offs. For example, deciding between AWS Lambda and Fargate for the build server. Start-up times, scalability, and timeout constraints led the team to favor Fargate over Lambda. In the process of retrieving real-time deployment data from the build server to the dashboard, AWS CloudFormation, CloudWatch, and Lambda functions were leveraged.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Trellis acts as an open-source, low-config continuous delivery deployment pipeline that simplifies the process of deploying serverless applications. With a focus on providing compatibility with AWS, Trellis offers real-time status updates, rollback and promote code options, and handles phases of deployments.

## Future Work

There are plans for future improvements to Trellis such as user roles and permissions per application; optimizing deployment times by caching application dependencies; introduction of a command-line interface to manage and monitor deployments from a local console and allowing Trellis' integration with existing CI/CD pipelines when the serverless application is part of a larger application. 

## Post Presentation Notes

Following the presentation, the team answered questions and summarized their journey in the capstone project highlighting challenges they faced, milestones they achieved, and the benefits they derived from working in a team. The team reiterated that while they were initially inexperienced with AWS, they saw significant growth in their understanding through their hands-on experiences.
