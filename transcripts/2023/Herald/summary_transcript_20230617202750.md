# Coding Capstone Project - Harold

## Introduction
In this video, the presenters introduce "Harold," an observability solution that simplifies the deployment of the elk stack. They explain what observability is, why it is important, and the challenges involved in implementing an observability solution. They discuss existing solutions in the observability space and outline where Harold fits in. The video also covers the design decisions and implementation challenges faced in building Harold.

## Explanation
### Observability
Observability refers to the ability to understand how a system is functioning based on its outputs and behaviors. In the context of software systems, observability involves collecting and analyzing three types of telemetry data: logs, traces, and metrics.

- **Logs**: Records of events or messages generated by a software application or system. These provide detailed information about specific events or actions within the system.
- **Traces**: Data collected about the different stages of a request as it passes through various components or services of the system. Traces help engineers identify the services involved and analyze their interactions.
- **Metrics**: Numeric representations of data measured over time intervals. Metrics help developers track performance goals and identify problems.

These three types of data work together to provide developers with visibility into their software systems, allowing them to diagnose issues and improve performance.

### Herald - Simplifying Observability
Harold is an observability solution designed to simplify the deployment of the elk stack. The elk stack is a popular set of open-source tools used for monitoring the health and performance of software systems. Harold allows developers to conveniently collect and explore telemetry data, including logs, traces, and metrics, through a single user-friendly interface.

### Tools Used in Harold
- **Elasticsearch**: A distributed search and analytics engine that stores and indexes data for fast searching and querying.
- **Logstash**: A tool for processing and transforming log data before it is stored and indexed in Elasticsearch.
- **Kibana**: An open-source data visualization and exploration platform used to search, analyze, and visualize data stored in Elasticsearch.
- **Filebeat**: A collection agent designed to collect and ship log data to Logstash for processing.
- **Elastic APM (Application Performance Monitoring) agents**: Specialized agents that collect traces and metrics data from an application.
- **Fleet server**: A centralized tool used to manage Elastic agents.
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services) Cloud Development Kit (CDK)**: An infrastructure-as-code tool that allows developers to provision AWS resources using the same code used to build an application.
- **AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)**: A fully managed container orchestration service used for deploying and managing containerized applications.
- **AWS Cloud Map**: A service discovery tool used to create a private DNS network and assign DNS hostnames to services.
- **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: A secure communication protocol used to encrypt communication between components.

### Challenges Addressed in Harold
The presenters outline the four main challenges in implementing an observability solution and how Harold addresses them:

1. **Data Collection**: Harold uses Filebeat to collect and ship log data and Elastic APM agents to collect traces and metrics data. These agents are installed on each application server and send the data to central storage.
2. **Data Processing and Transformation**: Harold uses Logstash for processing and transforming log data, and the APM server for processing traces and metrics data before sending it to Elasticsearch.
3. **Data Storage**: Elasticsearch serves as the data storage component, allowing fast and efficient querying for real-time data analysis.
4. **Data Visualization**: Kibana is used for data visualization, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface to search, analyze, and visualize the data stored in Elasticsearch.

### Architecture
The presenters explain the overall architecture of Harold, which is deployed using AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) and AWS resources:

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: Harold and the user's application reside within the same VPC.
- **Private Subnet**: The private subnet hosts Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Fleet server.
- **Public Subnet**: The public subnet hosts Kibana, which requires a public IP address.
- **Elasticsearch Cluster**: Consists of multiple nodes for handling data ingestion, storage, and indexing. Auto scaling is implemented to handle fluctuations in data volume.
- **Logstash Cluster**: Uses load balancers to distribute loads evenly across nodes for processing log data.
- **Fleet Server Cluster**: Manages the Elastic agents installed on application servers for data collection.
- **APM Server Cluster**: Handles the validation and transformation of traces and metrics data collected by the Elastic APM agents.
- **Cloud Map**: Provides service discovery within the Harold application.
- **Elastic File System**: A centralized volume storage for containerized applications.
- **CloudWatch**: Used for application logging.
- **Lambda Function**: Responsible for shutting down the Elasticsearch instance used for certificate generation.

### Development Workload
The presenters followed a divide-and-conquer approach to distribute the development workload. They used a Trello board to organize tasks and regularly met to discuss any issues or problems during development.

### ELI5 Summary
Harold is a solution that makes it easier for developers to monitor the health and performance of their software systems. It does this by collecting and analyzing different types of data, like logs, traces, and metrics, all in one place. By using open-source tools like Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, Harold provides an interface that developers can use to understand how their systems are working and find and fix any issues. It was built using AWS infrastructure and the AWS CDK, allowing developers to deploy and manage the solution more easily on the Amazon Cloud.
