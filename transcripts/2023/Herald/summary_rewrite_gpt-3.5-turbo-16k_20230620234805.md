# Harold: Simplifying Observability with the ELK Stack

This is a detailed analysis of a coding Capstone project video discussing a solution called Harold. Harold is an observability solution that simplifies the deployment of the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack. The video covers various aspects related to observability, the challenges involved in implementing an observability solution, existing solutions in the observability space, and the functionalities, design decisions, and implementation challenges of Harold.

## Observability
Observability refers to the ability to understand how a system is functioning based on its outputs and behaviors. The video explains that observability relies on three pillars of telemetry data: logs, traces, and metrics.

## Telemetry Data
The three pillars of telemetry data, logs, traces, and metrics, are explained in detail. 

### Logs
Logs are detailed records of events or messages generated by a software application or system. They provide information about specific events or actions, such as time stamps, message content, severity levels, and contextual information.

### Traces
Traces involve analyzing a software system by collecting data about the different stages of a request as it moves through various components or services. Traces help identify the services a request passes through and how they interact, allowing engineers to pinpoint performance bottlenecks and improve user experience.

### Metrics
Metrics provide a numeric representation of data measured over time intervals, acting as vital signs for a software system. They help developers understand the health of a system by studying performance goals and baselines. Metrics allow developers to track whether a system is meeting its targets and catch problems before they become critical.

## ELI5 Summary
Harold is a software solution that makes it easy for developers to monitor the health and performance of their software systems. It collects three types of data: logs (detailed records of events), traces (information about request paths and interactions), and metrics (numeric measurements). The collected data is stored in a central location, and developers can visualize and analyze it using a user-friendly interface. Harold simplifies the deployment of the ELK stack for developers, allowing them to maintain control over their data and infrastructure.

## Tools Used
The video discusses several specific tools used in the implementation of Harold:

- **Filebeat**: A collection agent used for log data collection.
- **Elastic APM agent**: An open-source library that collects tracing and metrics data generated by an application.
- **Logstash**: Used for data processing and transformation of log data.
- **Elasticsearch**: A distributed search and analytics engine used as the data storage component.
- **Kibana**: A data visualization tool used to visualize and analyze data stored in Elasticsearch.
- **AWS resources**: Amazon Web Services resources (such as VPC, EC2, Fargate, CloudWatch, Elastic File System, Cloud Map, Lambda) are used to deploy and manage Harold.
- **AWS CDK**: The Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is an infrastructure-as-code tool used to provision AWS resources using code.

In summary, Harold is an open-source observability solution that simplifies the deployment of the ELK stack. It collects logs, traces, and metrics to provide developers with insights into the health and performance of their software systems. Harold leverages tools such as Filebeat, Elastic APM agent, Logstash, Elasticsearch, and Kibana to aggregate, process, store, and visualize the telemetry data. The AWS CDK is used for infrastructure provisioning.
