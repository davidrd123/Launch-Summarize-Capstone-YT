# Otter: Peer-to-Peer Cloud-native Framework for Video Communication within Web Applications

Group members: Connor, Chris, Max, and Kush

## ELI5 Summary
In simpler terms, imagine that Alice and Bob want to video call each other. Usually, Alice would call Bob using an app, their audio and video would go through a central server, and then reach the other person. But with Otter, the team's project, Alice and Bob can video call each other directly, without the need for a central server. This is faster and more private, but there are some things they need to figure out first, like their own IP addresses and how to get around any firewalls. Otter does all this automatically and provides a more efficient way for developers to add video calling into their web applications.

## Tools Used

- Cloud Services: AWS (EC2, Fargate, ECS, CloudFront, DynamoDB)
- Coding Languages: JavaScript (React, CLI)
- Libraries/APIs: WebRTC
- Other Technologies: NAT devices, STUN/TURN servers, WebSocket Gateway, Lambdas

## Detailed Explanation

### Video Calling: Client-Server Model vs Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network 

Today, video calling is prominent in various applications ranging from telehealth, online classes to virtual business meetings. Even though developers want to incorporate this feature into their applications, they have to make careful design choices, particularly regarding the choice between the client-server model and the peer-to-peer network model.

#### Client-Server Model
In this model, all devices connect to a central server for communication. It offers two key advantages:

- It can support larger call sizes as the server manages the connections.
- Allows for additional features like real-time processing and recording of calls. 

Nevertheless, it also has a downside. The central server monitors the communication, leading to a lack of privacy for end-users.

#### Peer-to-Peer Network Model
In contrast, the devices in a peer-to-peer network communicate directly without a central server. It offers several benefits:

- Increased user privacy since data does not pass through a central server that monitors it.
- Reduced latency since data can travel directly between peers without server intermediation.
- Increased network resilience as there is no single point of failure like a central server.
- Cost-effectiveness for developers who no longer have to maintain servers.

However, peer-to-peer networks also pose challenges when it comes to call sizes. Since each peer needs to connect to every other peer, this becomes difficult when there are many participants. 

### Latency and Protocols Needed for Data Transmission

Another crucial concept to address is latency. High latency means data takes longer to travel from its origin to its destination, leading to delays in video calls. To minimize latency, developers need to choose between two main data transmission protocols - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

- **TCP:** While TCP guarantees the reliable transmission of data, this comes at a higher latency cost, making it less ideal for real-time video calling.
- **UDP:** In contrast, UDP offers faster transmission without the guarantee of delivery, making it more suitable for real-time video calls where speed is essential.

### WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)

WebRTC is a free technology developed by Google that makes the implementation of peer-to-peer video calling easier by abstracting away the complexities of protocols. In addition to providing end-to-end encryption, it bypasses restrictive network environments and establishes reliable communication channels over UDP. Several web applications, such as Google Meet, Facebook Messenger, and Discord, widely apply it.

#### Easing the Process of Video Calls between Two Peers

A successful video call setup depends on the two peers knowing their IP addresses in various scenarios.

1. **Same Local Network:** When both peers are on the same local network, the communication becomes straightforward, with both using their private IP addresses to establish the connection. But this scenario is not common.
   
2. **Different Private Networks:** In case both peers are across different private networks on the internet, they need to use their public IP addresses. This is where Network Address Translation (NAT) devices play a pivotal role by acting as gateways for hosts within a private network to access the internet. The NAT device modifies outgoing messages from a private IP to a public IP, allowing cross-network communication.

3. **Behind a Restricted Network Environment:** When a peer is behind a restricted network, such as a firewall, the video call setup gets more challenging. However, WebRTC provides techniques to bypass such restrictions, ensuring a steady connection.

### Otter - A Framework for Video Calling

Leveraging the power of WebRTC, Otter provides a user-friendly framework for developers to integrate video calling into their web applications. The primary aim for Otter's future plans is its continuous improvement, including enhancing support for larger call sizes in P2P networks, developing additional features for the client-server model, and exploring ways to optimize latency.

### Otter's Architecture
Otter includes three essential components:

1. A React web application offering peer-to-peer calls with audio, video, instant messaging and, file sharing.
2. A developer-friendly command-line interface (CLI) that eases infrastructure deployment and maintenance.
3. An API that allows developers to integrate Otter into their web applications.

Otter leverages AWS services and the serverless paradigm, reducing the complexity of provisioning and managing servers, and allowing developers to concentrate on their core application logic. 

The Otter project is divided into four stacks:

1. **Signaling Stack:** Handles peer interaction utilizing websockets, and includes a websocket gateway and Lambda functions to manage various events such as connection, message passing, and disconnection.
2. **STUN/TURN Stack:** Offers the required infrastructure for managing peer-to-peer connnections across networks and includes STUN and TURN servers leveraging the serverless paradigm demanding minimal maintenance.
3. **Front-End Stack:** Involves the React web application enabling peer-to-peer calls with audio, video, instant messaging, and file sharing. 
4. **API Stack:** Allows developers to integrate Otter into their web applications.

In conclusion, Otter provides a user-friendly, cloud-native solution for developers to add video calling functionality into their applications. The choice between custom implementation, using commercial SDKs or leveraging the serverless paradigm with Otter depends on developers' needs and requirements.
