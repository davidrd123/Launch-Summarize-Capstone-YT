# Capstone Project Video Analysis

As per the transcript provided, the capstone project is about Symphony - an open-source framework developed to assist other developers in creating collaborative web applications, such as Google Docs, Trello, Miro, and Figma, more simplified. 

## ELI5 Summary

The project team created a solution called Symphony to make it easier for developers to build applications like Google Docs, where many people can work on the same content without interfering with each other's changes. They have efficiently achieved this using various technologies and tools and demonstrated it with an example of a collaborative whiteboard.

## System Design

The team has employed various technologies and tools to build Symphony, including a variety of AWS services, WebSocket and WebRTC protocols for real-time data transmission, and specific conflict resolution mechanisms such as Operational Transformation (OT) and Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDT). Here is a brief on their underlying concept:

### Real-time Collaboration:

The concept revolves around enabling multiple users to work together and modify the same content simultaneously. This involves components like a room (group of users collaborating), a docent (shared state being modified), and presence (actions users take in real-time).

### Transmission of Real-time Data:

Transmission of real-time data is done through WebRTC and WebSocket protocol. WebRTC enables peer-to-peer communication, which is apt for video and audio streaming due to its low latency, cost of potential data loss. WebSocket, on the other hand, allows two-way persistent real-time communication between the client and the server ensuring data integrity.

### Conflict Resolution:

The resolution of conflicts arising due to simultaneous changes made by multiple users is achieved using Operational Transformation (OT) and Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDT). OT transforms operations to apply in any order, and CRDT allows independent modifications to reach a convergent state by applying operations in any order without conflict.

## Tools Used

Below is the list of specific tools used in the project:

### Cloud Services:
- AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
- AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)
- AWS's Relational Database Service (RDS) 
- AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) 
- Amazon Elasticache
- AWS DynamoDB

### Languages:
- Abstract Data Type (for CRDT)
- JavaScript (for Yjs CRDT library)
- WebSocket (Real-time client-server communication)

### Other Technologies:
- Symphony Client Library
- Symphony CLI tool
- Kafka 
- RabbitMQ 
- WebRTC (Real-time browser to browser communication)
- Redis pub-sub messaging system

## Implementation

Symphony allows developers to create collaborative web applications by installing a Symphony client and a Symphony CLI tool, writing the app using the provided APIs and data structures, and finally deploying the application. Symphony uses the Yjs CRDT library for conflict resolution and WebSocket for real-time update transmission, and the backend is deployed on various AWS services. 

The Whiteboard demo shows how users can see others' presence, represented by moving cursors, and draw on the whiteboard, creating a persistent state in real-time.

## Application Architecture

Symphony's architecture consists of various components, which interact to perform real-time collaboration with conflict resolution:

- **Symphony client**: The client-side component where users perform collaborative tasks.
- **Symphony CLI tool**: A command-line tool for creating and managing Symphony applications.
- **WebSocket**: Provides real-time communication between client-side Symphony applications and the Symphony server.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker.
- **CRDT**: An algorithm used to handle the conflict between simultaneous changes made by multiple users.
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: A platform that provides a variety of cloud-based services to power the application.
- **Live Blocks/ Fluid Framework**: Tools or frameworks for building real-time collaborative applications.

## Scaling

The Symphony application is designed for scalability, allowing it to serve a large number of users and applications simultaneously. The application makes use of AWS's Elastic Container Service (ECS) for scalability. With the help of Redis pub-sub messaging system, Symphony achieves horizontal scaling, allowing multiple WebSocket servers to handle a high number of connections. 

## Future Plans

The team has identified areas for future improvements including â€“ eliminating duplicate states in a single room across multiple servers and optimizing CPU and memory utilization by assigning one process per room. 

## Conclusion

Symphony is an innovative, open-source solution aimed at simplifying the development of collaborative web applications by abstracting away the complexities involved in real-time infrastructure and conflict resolution. With the use of different technologies that complement each other in this architecture, Symphony provides a scalable solution for developers to build engaging and interactive applications.
