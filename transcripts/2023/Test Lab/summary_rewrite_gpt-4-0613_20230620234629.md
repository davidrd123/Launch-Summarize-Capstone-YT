# Test Lab: A Feature Flag and Ad Testing Platform

## Summary

The project presented is a tool called Test Lab, which provides a platform for A/B testing, feature management, and infrastructure to help in feature rollouts, experiment creation, and feature toggles. The team employed a range of technologies and methodologies to develop it, which we will explore in detail below. 

## ELI5 (Explain Like I'm Five)

Do you remember when you couldn't decide whether you liked strawberry or chocolate ice cream better, so you had a little bit of both and then picked your favorite? That's basically what A/B testing is! And Test Lab is like your helper in the ice cream shop. It lets you try out different parts of a website (like a button or a color) to see what people like and use more. 

## Detailed Explanation

### Concepts and Methods

- **A/B Testing**: The process of comparing two versions of a website or application to see which one performs better. It's like a science experiment for your website. 

- **Feature Toggles**: A technique that allows developers to turn certain features on and off, often used for testing purposes or to gradually introduce new features.

- **Rollouts**: This refers to gradually introducing a feature to users, which can be a safer way to implement changes and see their impact. 

### Testing Approaches

Three primary approaches are employed: 

1. Client-side implementation: This is where changes are made on the page the user sees by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using Javascript.
2. Server-side implementation: This is where changes are made directly on the server, enabling more access to user data. 
3. Content delivery networks (CDNs): These can route users to different versions of a site, but they lack access to user data. 

### Test Lab: The Solution

Test Lab offers a compelling solution by enabling the collection and storage of event data. It provides an open-source, locally-hosted platform that doesn't require a massive analytics infrastructure, thanks to API calls integrated into event listeners.

## Architecture of Test Lab

Test Lab consists of four main components:

- An administrative user interface built with **React**.
- A back-end server built with **Node.js Express**.
- A **PostgreSQL** database for persistent data storage.
- Native SDKs (Software Development Kits) for integration into server and client-side rendered applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript (both for frontend with React and backend with Node.js Express), SQL (for dealing with PostgreSQL database), along with Ruby and Python for providing native SDKs.
- **Database Systems**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend Frameworks/Libraries**: React.js
- **Backend Frameworks/Libraries**: Express.js in Node.js
- **Other Tools**: Docker (for creating containers and ensuring the platform can be reliably and consistently deployed), Jest (for writing tests), API documentation tools, hashing functions for user ID assignment.
