# ELI5

The project is called Seamless. It's an easy-to-use tool developed to help small organizations manage their automation process, particularly when dealing with microservices (very small, independent applications that do one thing really well). Imagine you have a factory where you assemble cars. Each part of the car (engine, wheels, doors) is made in different rooms (microservices) and then put together in an assembly line (CI/CD pipelines). Now if you had to control and check on each room multiple times a day, it would be a lot of work (manual deployments). But what if there was a tool (Seamless) that kept an eye on everything and only alerted you when something wasn't working right? This is exactly what Seamless is designed to do.

# Detailed Breakdown

**Intro:** The team of three - Ethan Weiner, Rhonda Young, and Jason White, introduced Seamless, an open-source Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tool. It is specially designed to streamline the deployment of small containerized microservices applications. 

## Part 1 - Problem Domain

**Deployment Process:** The deployment process refers to the phase where code developed on a local machine is made ready to be used on a live production environment. This typically involves four steps: identifying the source code using a version control system like GitHub (Source), running tests to ensure the quality and functionality of the code (Test),  packaging the source code and its dependencies into an artifact ready to be deployed (Build), and shipping the artifact to the production environment forusage by end-users (Deploy). 

**Deployment Process Types:** There are two types of deployment process. 

1. Manual Deployment - involves manually performing most steps by developers, maintainers, or operation staff.
2. Automated Deployment - involves triggering the deployment process immediately upon updates in version control resulting in faster and more reliable deployment process.

**CI/CD Trade-off:** CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) strikes a balance between manual deployments and fully automated deployments. It permits companies to optimize their deployment process safety by combining both practices. Continuous integration focuses on regularly merging code into a central repository, with the option to automate or require manual review before merging. Continuous delivery extends this by preparing new builds for release, and continuous deployment goes a step further by immediately releasing the new version into production.

**CI/CD challenges with Microservices:** Microservices are smaller, independently deployable parts of an application. Managing the CI/CD pipeline for them can be challenging due to their distributed nature and independent deployment. Their testing also requires a balance between unit testing (individual components), integration testing (multiple services together), and testing in a staging environment (replicate production conditions).

## Part 2 â€“ Introduction to Seamless

**Seamless:** The team created Seamless as an open-source, user-friendly solution for managing CI/CD pipelines for containerized microservices deployed on AWS ECS Fargate. Seamless comes with standard pipeline stages ready to use 'out-of-the-box', and it allows customisation of workflow. Users can test microservices individually or together and enables pipeline monitoring and notifications. 

**Installation:** Installation and setup of Seamless include installing the Seamless npm package globally, provisioning infrastructure on AWS using the CLI, and setting up the pipeline through the Seamless dashboard.

## Part 3 - Challenges in Building the Pipeline

The four key challenges faced by the team were modeling/storing pipeline data efficiently, automatically triggering the pipeline based on specific events such as a new code commit, managing different pipeline tasks concurrently, and executing the tasks ensuring a seamless CI/CD experience.

# Tools Used in the Project

**Cloud Services:** AWS ECS Fargate, AWS Step Functions, AWS Elastic File System (EFS), AWS Elastic Block Storage(EBS), AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), Application Load Balance Target Service (from the AWS EC patterns library), AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) and EC2.

**Languages:** JavaScript, json, PostgreSQL (database), shell commands.

**Other Technologies:** Docker, GitHub, Redis cache, Node.js (using Express server, with the backend designed to scale via Fargate and a load balancer), NPM (Node package manager, for package installation), Docker Compose (for container management and networking), Prisma ORM (for schema updates), Websockets (for handling updates from the backend to the dashboard), and Execca (to run shell commands).
