# Seamless: A CI/CD Tool for Containerized Microservices

## Introduction

In this video presentation, the team introduces Seamless, an open source Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tool specifically designed for containerized microservice applications. The team discusses the problem domain, the challenges of CI/CD pipelines for microservices, existing CI/CD tools, and provides a detailed overview of Seamless's core infrastructure and functionalities.

## Problem Domain

The team starts by explaining what a deployment process is - the steps involved in getting new code from a developer's machine to a production environment. They outline the four core stages of a deployment process: Source, Test, Build, and Deploy.

They then discuss the two types of deployment processes: manual and automated. They explain that manual deployments are slower and less reliable than automated ones. Manual deployments require human intervention, leading to delays and potential inconsistencies between local and production environments. In contrast, automated deployments trigger immediately upon updates in version control, leading to faster and more reliable releases.

## Trade-off in Automated Deployments

The team highlights a trade-off in automated deployments. While automated deployments are generally faster and safer, a complete switch from manual deployments to fully automated pipelines can be risky, especially for companies without a comprehensive test suite. They introduce the concept of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) as combined practices that address this trade-off.

Continuous Integration (CI) focuses on merging code into the main branch of a central repository regularly. It aims to quickly get developers' code into the main branch, enhancing speed. However, the team notes that automating merging can introduce the risk of merging untested code. Continuous Delivery (CD) extends CI by regularly promoting builds to a staging environment for manual approval. This increases safety by allowing human code reviews before deployment.

The team explains that companies can enhance the safety of their CI/CD pipelines by mandating human code reviews and using a staging environment. Conversely, they can enhance the velocity of their pipeline by automating merging and continuously deploying.

## Challenges of CI/CD Pipelines for Microservices

The team then delves into the challenges faced when applying CI/CD to microservices specifically. They identify two main challenges: pipeline management and comprehensive testing.

For pipeline management, the team explains that organizations can either create individual CI/CD pipelines for each microservice or adopt a single reusable pipeline. While individual pipelines provide more control, they can be challenging to maintain for organizations with a large number of microservices. On the other hand, a single reusable pipeline reduces redundancy but still requires managing multiple pipelines and shared steps.

Regarding comprehensive testing, the team outlines three approaches: unit testing, integration testing, and staging environments. They explain that microservices need to be tested both internally (unit testing) and in conjunction with other microservices they interact with (integration testing). Staging environments replicate production conditions and enable comprehensive system testing. The team emphasizes their use of isolated test environments to avoid impacting production during integration testing.

## Existing CI/CD Solutions and Seamless

The team discusses some existing CI/CD solutions and how Seamless compares to them. Open source DIY tools like Jenkins and GitLab offer customization capabilities but require knowledge of plugins and integrations. Commercial solutions like CodeFresh and CircleCI are user-friendly but may lack flexibility compared to open source tools.

The team positions Seamless as a solution for companies with limited resources that struggle to manage CI/CD pipelines for multiple microservices. Seamless is designed for node-based containerized microservices deployed to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) Fargate. It offers a standard set of pipeline stages, customization options, microservice testing (in isolation and together), pipeline monitoring, and notifications.

## Architecture and Infrastructure of Seamless

The team provides an overview of Seamless's core infrastructure and architecture. They explain the data model, which supports multiple services with one-to-many relationships. The team chose Postgres on Amazon RDS and used the Prisma ORM for schema updates.

They detail the automation of pipeline triggers using webhooks. When code is updated in the repository, GitHub sends a webhook to Seamless's backend, which retrieves the necessary pipeline data from the database and triggers the pipeline using a state machine. The team explains the use of Step Functions, an AWS service, to manage tasks and orchestrate the cloning, testing, building, and deployment of code.

Task executors, as part of the seamless architecture, perform individual tasks within each container. The team explores two approaches to running Docker containers inside containers: true Docker-in-Docker and sibling containers. They use ECS on EC2 to execute tasks and EFS for shared data storage between containers.

The team also highlights monitoring features within Seamless, including a dashboard, logging service, and notifications. They discuss the use of websockets to update the dashboard with near real-time status and log information. Logs are stored using a Redis cache, and status updates are sent as notifications via various notification services.

## Scaling and Future Development

The team addresses scaling optimizations within Seamless. They explain how they handle multiple pipeline runs in parallel and the use of AWS Step Functions and load balancers to handle increased load.

The team also mentions future areas of development for Seamless, including adding more testing and deployment options, supporting additional runtimes, and implementing caching mechanisms to speed up the pipeline.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Seamless is an open-source CI/CD tool designed for containerized microservices deployed to AWS ECS Fargate. It offers a simplified and easy-to-use solution for companies with limited resources managing CI/CD pipelines for multiple microservices. Seamless provides a standard set of pipeline stages, customization options, microservice testing, pipeline monitoring, and notifications. The team highlights the challenges and advantages of automated deployment pipelines, discusses the specific challenges of CI/CD for microservices, and compares Seamless to existing CI/CD solutions. They also explain the core infrastructure and architecture behind Seamless, including the data model, pipeline triggers, task management, and scaling optimizations. With future development, Seamless aims to support more use cases and functionalities to meet the evolving needs of users.

**ELI5:** Seamless is a tool that helps developers efficiently deploy their code to the production environment. It automates the deployment process, which involves several steps like collecting code, running tests, packaging the code, and shipping it to the production environment. The tool also ensures that only high-quality and functional code is released to end users by performing automated tests.

Seamless is specifically designed for a type of software architecture called microservices, where applications are split into smaller and independent parts. This allows each part to be deployed separately, which is more flexible and efficient. However, managing the deployment process for microservices can be challenging because there are many services to coordinate.

Seamless solves this problem by providing a user-friendly and open-source tool. It simplifies the pipeline setup and management for companies with multiple microservices. It has a built-in dashboard for monitoring the pipeline progress and notifications for important updates. The tool also supports different types of testing, such as unit testing and integration testing, to ensure that the microservices work properly together.

Overall, Seamless makes the deployment process faster and more reliable, especially for companies with limited resources managing multiple microservices. It allows developers to focus on writing code and ensures that their code gets delivered to users quickly and safely.
