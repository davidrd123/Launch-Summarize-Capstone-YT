# Project Analysis: Tinker

## ELI5 Summary

Tinker is like a magic tool for software developers. Normally, when developers make apps, they have to do lots of boring jobs to make the stored information (the backend stuff) work right. Tinker helps by doing those boring jobs for them, so they have more fun creating the front part of the app (what you can see and interact with).

It's a friendly tool that doesn't live on someone else's computer (i.e., a service provider) but instead can live right on your own computer or whatever place you choose to handle your data, providing more flexibility and control.

It also gets along well with PostgreSQL, a type of system that organizes the data, making it even easier for the developers to work with this data.

## Detailed Explanation 

### Tinker - An Overview

Tinker is an open-source Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) project that simplifies and automates the process of developing an application's backend. It is especially beneficial for developers who want to focus on the front-end aspect without concerning themselves with the backend server and database set up.

The design and operations of Tinker are based on simplifying automated configurations, deployment speed and integrating the backend infrastructure using a user-friendly approach. Using Tinker, developers can swiftly move from just an idea to the proof of concept, it's this level of efficiency that makes Tinker unique and useful for developers.

Tinker uses Superbase as its database, which is unique because it is a relational database compared to other BaaS solutions that use schema-less NoSQL databases. Superbase helps perform common database operations, automating the backend configuration in user-friendly ways.

Tinker's architecture consists of two components, a Command-line Interface, and a UI Dashboard. All the deployment and provisioning of AWS resources is handled via CLI. The Dashboard is an interactive interface that allows users to work with a PostgreSQL database using an intuitive table editor.

### Tools and Technologies

To develop and operate Tinker, a range of tools and technologies were used which include: 

- **Superbase**: An open-source relational database that simplifies working with data.
  
- **Command-line Interface (CLI)**: Handles the provisioning of Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources.
    
- **Dashboard User Interface**: Allows users to manage their backend databases.
  
- **CloudFormation**: Manages the complete deployment and provisioning process.
    
- **PostgreSQL**: Used with stored procedures to handle API and DDL operations.
    
- **PostgREST**: An open-source web server that generates a RESTful API from a PostgreSQL schema.
    
- **Docker**: Used for automating the deployment of the application.

To sum it up, Tinker assists developers in rapidly moving from an idea to a working concept by focusing on the front-end development whilst the Backend-as-a-Service (Tinker) take care of the backend infrastructure. 

### Security

As for the security concerns with JWT and user credentials, an Application Load Balancer (ALB) was used to handle HTTPS requests adding an extra layer of security by ensuring the Authenticity of the Transport Layer Security certificate. User identification and authorization were handled using JWT and PostgreSQL roles respectively.

### Transition and Migration

Helping users migrate off of Tinker is enabled by using PostgreSQL's 'pg_dump command' to backup data and the schema when a user wants to switch to other cloud services or move to an on-premise server.
  
### Automating Deployment

Automating the deployment of the admin backend and user Backend was achieved using Docker to streamline the process by packaging the applications and their dependencies into isolated runtime system containers which makes it easier to manage and deploy.

# Questions & Answers

#### Q: What part of working on Tinker was your favorite?

A: Building the dashboard, seeing automated processes work seamlessly, teamwork, and collaboration.

#### Q: Did you find AI Tools useful in researching such a complex project?

A: AI tools, like ChatGPT, were used for research purposes and to provide boilerplate code.

#### Q: How did you learn about and implement AWS components for this project?

A: Through AWS documentation, Utilizing stack overflow & tutorials, hands-on experience and experimentation.

#### Q: How did you come up with the idea for Tinker?

A: Inspired by Super Bass, which led to the implementation of a backend-as-a-service concept with additional features.

#### Q: What were some of the difficult decisions you had to make?

A: How to handle backend provisioning by deciding to do it through CLI instead of through the dashboard due to security complications.

#### Q: How did you divide the work among team members?

A: Roles were assigned based on individual strengths, task requirements, and shifting responsibilities based on urgency. This was facilitated by daily team meetings and a preference for open communication on Slack.
