# Pennant - Cloud-based Collaborative Computational Notebook

Pennant is a cloud-based collaborative computational notebook developed as a capstone project. It focuses on real-time collaboration and remote code execution. Pennant allows multiple users to manipulate and run code in a shared programming environment, with provisions for documentation using formatted markdown cells. 

## ELI5 Summary

Just like how Google Docs allows multiple people to work on a document together, Pennant lets multiple people write and run code together in the same digital notebook, all from their individual browsers.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in the project:

**Cloud Service:**
- AWS (For Hosting, AWS S3 for notebook storage, DynamoDB as a database, and others)

**Languages:**
- JavaScript (for tool and palette development)
  
**Other Technologies:**
- WebSocket API (Used in its collaboration service)
- Docker (For creating isolated environments, containerization)
- CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type used for real-time collaboration)
- Yjs (A CRDT library used for memory efficiency and conflict resolution)
- VM2 (A sandbox library used for securitizing executions)

# Key Functionalities

## Real-time Collaboration
Pennant allows for real-time collaboration between multiple users on the same notebook, which is crucial for use-cases involving collective work on big data analysis, machine learning, and data visualizations. The challenge in supporting real-time collaborations was maintaining a shared view and state across all the users. Pennant uses Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDT), coupled with synchronization algorithms, to achieve state convergence despite continuous updates.

## Independent Code Execution
Another key feature is the facility to break code into cells and execute them independently and in any order. This feature promotes experimentation by allowing users to modify and rerun individual code cells without executing the entire notebook from the start. The order-dependent execution ensures a stateful execution context making Pennant a suitable platform for persistent coding exercises.

## Secure Code Execution
With Pennant's remote code execution engine, user-entered code is run securely using methods such as sandbox environments and resource limits. Untrusted code is executed in these isolated environments to reduce the risk of malicious activities. To ensure safety and performance, user submissions are also algorithmically reviewed and monitored.

## Presence Awareness

Pennant's collaboration service includes real-time presence and awareness functionality, where users can see who else is active on the notebook. This visibility promotes efficient collaboration by invoking awareness of concurrent editing.

## Use Standard Javascript
One of the goals for this project was to use standard JavaScript. To minimize the learning curve and therefore make it easier for users to start using Pennant, the decision was made to avoid using non-standard versions of JavaScript.


# Project Implementation
The structure of the Pennant system consists of three pivotal elements: 
- The Collaboration Service
- Code Execution Engine
- Web Server

The collaboration service provides real-time synchronization, enabling users to work simultaneously on a project. Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types and custom algorithms are incorporated to facilitate seamless sharing and merging of updates, thereby maintaining notebook integrity across all users. Rooms concept is implemented to handle multiple notebooks within Pennant without interference with one another.

Code execution is handled server-side, where the user's code submissions are run securely. This execution involves reducing wait time, ensuring the system's reliability, and implementing thorough security measures. Long-running processes persist execution context objects in memory to contribute towards more responsive and faster execution.

The web server handles user login and notebook access.

# Project Completion

The system was successfully implemented, and it now allows for collaborative editing and execution of code within digital notebooks. The trade-off between client-side and server-side execution was critically evaluated, with server-side being chosen for enhanced user experience. Necessary measures have been undertaken to ensure server-side execution is speedy, efficient, and secure.

By having a shared environment but independent execution entities, Pennant brings together the best of both worlds â€“ collaboration and independence. Anyone interested can learn more about the Pennant Notebook by visiting their website.

# Post-launch Reflection

During the project reflection, the team expressed learning a lot about real-time synchronization and collaboration features. The most difficult part was reportedly synchronization across various browsers and devices. The experience was seen as practically enlightening, and the key to overcoming challenges was seen in the efficiency of collaboration and exploration of multiple problem-solving approaches. The team also emphasized that if they were to start again, more time would be dedicated to addressing limitations and compatibility issues right at the onset, thus making the following stages of the project more streamlined.

I hope you found this summary useful and easy to follow. Let me know if you have any questions.
