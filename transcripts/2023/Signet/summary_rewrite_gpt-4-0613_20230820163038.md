# Capstone Project - Signant

## Introduction

[Signant](https://github.com/Signant) is an open-source contract testing framework for microservices, developed by a group of software engineers: Zach, Michael, Fernando, and Eric.

## What is a Microservice?

Microservice architecture is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services. Each service typically corresponds to a business capability and can be developed and deployed independently of others.

## Why Contract Testing with Microservices?

Microservices offer benefits over monolithic architecture but present unique challenges when it comes to testing them. Traditional monolithic applications are usually tested through a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, sequenced from most simple (unit tests) to complex (end-to-end tests). For microservices, the nature of their independent behavior and the complexity of setting up integration environments lead the team to the concept of Contract Testing.

## Contract Testing

Contract Testing focuses on the compatibility of interfaces between services, rather than testing the entire integration. It makes use of a contract (a formal document which details the expected requests and responses between services), allowing for faster and less resource-intense tests. This approach doesn't replace end-to-end tests but complements them.

There are three types of contract testing models:
1. Conser-driven
2. Provider-driven
3. Spec-driven
  
The team opted for a spec-driven approach, allowing for independent development and testing of each service.

## Development of Signant

With consideration to these factors, the team developed their own contract testing framework, Signant, which is open source and self-hosted. It leverages existing service tests, generates contracts automatically from API specifications, and includes a dedicated contract broker. The solution integrates with the CI/CD pipeline and has been designed with the goal of improving development workflows and ensuring smooth deployments.

## Engineering Decisions

Engineering decisions were made to ensure that the specific contract testing needs of microservices were met. These decisions involved allowing for two types of documents: conser contracts and provider specifications. Conser contracts can be generated in two ways, either manually or automatically by recording service tests using a proxy.

The service was structured to work for both the conser and provider side of an integration. On the provider side, Signant generates tests from the API spec to ensure accurate implementation.

A distinct feature of Signant is its dedicated contract broker that acts as a central repository for contracts, enabling automatic comparisons between contracts and specifications for immediate feedback. This functionality sets Signant apart from other solutions that rely on version control systems for contract management.

Signant is designed to integrate with CI/CD pipelines using a command-line interface and can run workflows in response to webhooks emitted by the Signant broker.


## Conclusion

Signant is a comprehensive solution that cater to the contract testing needs of software development houses working with growing microservice environments. It focuses on a spec-driven approach, easy adoption, and the presence of a dedicated contract broker, among other features.


## ELI5 Summary

Think of microservices as different parts of a toy set - such as Lego blocks. If each block is developed independently and needs to connect or work together with other blocks to create a toy house or car, for example, we need a way to ensure that they will fit together correctly. This is where Signant comes in, providing a spec (instructions) about how each block ie.microservice, will interact. The team can then use these instructions to efficiently test if the blocks will fit together as expected. If they do, we know that our toy house or car will be built correctly.


## Specific Tools Used

1. Signant: Open-source contract testing framework developed by the team.
2. Pactflow and Specmatic: Existing contract testing solutions evaluated by the team before developing Signant.
3. AWS Cloud ECS Fargate: Infrastructure used for deploying contract broker within Signant.
4. Signant CLI: Tool used for setting up the necessary infrastructure and managing contract testing workflow.
5. Webhooks: Used for triggering contract testing workflows in response to certain events.
